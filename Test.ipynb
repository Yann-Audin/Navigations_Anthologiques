      "\r\n",
      "Now I, Allan Quatermain, come to the story of what was, perhaps, one of\r\n",
      "the strangest of all the adventures which have befallen me in the\r\n",
      "course of a life that so far can scarcely be called tame or humdrum.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Amongst many other things it tells of the war against the Black Kendah\r\n",
      "people and the death of Jana, their elephant god. Often since then I\r\n",
      "have wondered if this creature was or was not anything more than a mere\r\n",
      "gigantic beast of the forest. It seems improbable, even impossible, but\r\n",
      "the reader of future days may judge of this matter for himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Also he can form his opinion as to the religion of the White Kendah and\r\n",
      "their pretensions to a certain degree of magical skill. Of this magic I\r\n",
      "will make only one remark: If it existed at all, it was by no means\r\n",
      "infallible. To take a single instance, HarÃ»t and MarÃ»t were convinced\r\n",
      "by divination that I, and I only, could kill Jana, which was why they\r\n",
      "invited me to Kendahland. Yet in the end it was Hans who killed him.\r\n",
      "Jana nearly killed me!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now to my tale.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In another history, called âThe Holy Flower,â I have told how I came to\r\n",
      "England with a young gentleman of the name of Scroope, partly to see\r\n",
      "him safely home after a hunting accident, and partly to try to dispose\r\n",
      "of a unique orchid for a friend of mine called Brother John by the\r\n",
      "white people, and Dogeetah by the natives, who was popularly supposed\r\n",
      "to be mad, but, in fact, was very sane indeed. So sane was he that he\r\n",
      "pursued what seemed to be an absolutely desperate quest for over twenty\r\n",
      "years, until, with some humble assistance on my part, he brought it to\r\n",
      "a curiously successful issue. But all this tale is told in âThe Holy\r\n",
      "Flower,â and I only allude to it here, that is at present, to explain\r\n",
      "how I came to be in England.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While in this country I stayed for a few days with Scroope, or, rather,\r\n",
      "with his fiancÃ©e and her people, at a fine house in Essex. (I called it\r\n",
      "Essex to avoid the place being identified, but really it was one of the\r\n",
      "neighbouring counties.) During my visit I was taken to see a much finer\r\n",
      "place, a splendid old castle with brick gateway towers, that had been\r\n",
      "wonderfully well restored and turned into a most luxurious modern\r\n",
      "dwelling. Let us call it âRagnall,â the seat of a baron of that name.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I had heard a good deal about Lord Ragnall, who, according to all\r\n",
      "accounts, seemed a kind of Admirable Crichton. He was said to be\r\n",
      "wonderfully handsome, a great scholarâhe had taken a double first at\r\n",
      "college; a great athleteâhe had been captain of the Oxford boat at the\r\n",
      "University race; a very promising speaker who had already made his mark\r\n",
      "in the House of Lords; a sportsman who had shot tigers and other large\r\n",
      "game in India; a poet who had published a successful volume of verse\r\n",
      "under a pseudonym; a good solider until he left the Service; and\r\n",
      "lastly, a man of enormous wealth, owning, in addition to his estates,\r\n",
      "several coal mines and an entire town in the north of England.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âDear me!â I said when the list was finished, âhe seems to have been\r\n",
      "born with a whole case of gold spoons in his mouth. I hope one of them\r\n",
      "will not choke him,â adding: âPerhaps he will be unlucky in love.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThatâs just where he is most lucky of all,â answered the young lady to\r\n",
      "whom I was talkingâit was Scroopeâs fiancÃ©e, Miss Mannersââfor he is\r\n",
      "engaged to a lady that, I am told, is the loveliest, sweetest,\r\n",
      "cleverest girl in all England, and they absolutely adore each other.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âDear me!â I repeated. âI wonder what Fate _has_ got up its sleeve for\r\n",
      "Lord Ragnall and his perfect lady-love?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was doomed to find out one day.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So it came about that when, on the following morning, I was asked if I\r\n",
      "would like to see the wonders of Ragnall Castle, I answered âYes.â\r\n",
      "Really, however, I wanted to have a look at Lord Ragnall himself, if\r\n",
      "possible, for the account of his many perfections had impressed the\r\n",
      "imagination of a poor colonist like myself, who had never found an\r\n",
      "opportunity of setting his eyes upon a kind of human angel. Human\r\n",
      "devils I had met in plenty, but never a single angelâat least, of the\r\n",
      "male sex. Also there was always the possibility that I might get a\r\n",
      "glimpse of the still more angelic lady to whom he was engaged, whose\r\n",
      "name, I understood, was the Hon. Miss Holmes. So I said that nothing\r\n",
      "would please me more than to see this castle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thither we drove accordingly through the fine, frosty air, for the\r\n",
      "month was December. On reaching the castle, Mr. Scroope was told that\r\n",
      "Lord Ragnall, whom he knew well, was out shooting somewhere in the\r\n",
      "park, but that, of course, he could show his friend over the place. So\r\n",
      "we went in, the three of us, for Miss Manners, to whom Scroope was to\r\n",
      "be married very shortly, had driven us over in her pony carriage. The\r\n",
      "porter at the gateway towers took us to the main door of the castle and\r\n",
      "handed us over to another man, whom he addressed as Mr. Savage,\r\n",
      "whispering to me that he was his lordshipâs personal attendant.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I remember the name, because it seemed to me that I had never seen\r\n",
      "anyone who looked much less savage. In truth, his appearance was that\r\n",
      "of a duke in disguise, as I imagine dukes to be, for I never set eyes\r\n",
      "on one. His dressâhe wore a black morning cut-away coatâwas faultless.\r\n",
      "His manners were exquisite, polite to the verge of irony, but with a\r\n",
      "hint of haughty pride in the background. He was handsome also, with a\r\n",
      "fine nose and a hawk-like eye, while a touch of baldness added to the\r\n",
      "general effect. His age may have been anything between thirty-five and\r\n",
      "forty, and the way he deprived me of my hat and stick, to which I\r\n",
      "strove to cling, showed, I thought, resolution of character. Probably,\r\n",
      "I reflected to myself, he considers me an unusual sort of person who\r\n",
      "might damage the pictures and other objects of art with the stick, and\r\n",
      "not seeing his way how to ask me to give it up without suggesting\r\n",
      "suspicion, has hit upon the expedient of taking my hat also.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In after days Mr. Samuel Savage informed me that I was quite right in\r\n",
      "this surmise. He said he thought that, judging from my somewhat\r\n",
      "unconventional appearance, I might be one of the dangerous class of\r\n",
      "whom he had been reading in the papers, namely, a âhanarchist.â I write\r\n",
      "the word as he pronounced it, for here comes the curious thing. This\r\n",
      "man, so flawless, so well instructed in some respects, had a fault\r\n",
      "which gave everything away. His hâs were uncertain. Three of them would\r\n",
      "come quite right, but the fourth, let us say, would be conspicuous\r\n",
      "either by its utter absence or by its unwanted appearance. He could\r\n",
      "speak, when describing the Ragnall pictures, in rotund and flowing\r\n",
      "periods that would scarcely have disgraced the pen of Gibbon. Then\r\n",
      "suddenly that âhâ would appear or disappear, and the illusion was over.\r\n",
      "It was like a sudden shock of cold water down the back. I never\r\n",
      "discovered the origin of his family; it was a matter of which he did\r\n",
      "not speak, perhaps because he was vague about it himself; but if an\r\n",
      "earl of Norman blood had married a handsome Cockney kitchenmaid of\r\n",
      "native ability, I can quite imagine that Samuel Savage might have been\r\n",
      "a child of the union. For the rest he was a good man and a faithful\r\n",
      "one, for whom I have a high respect.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On this occasion he conducted us round the castle, or, rather, its more\r\n",
      "public rooms, showing us many treasures and, I should think, at least\r\n",
      "two hundred pictures by eminent and departed artists, which gave him an\r\n",
      "opportunity of exhibiting a peculiar, if somewhat erratic, knowledge of\r\n",
      "history. To tell the truth, I began to wish that it were a little less\r\n",
      "full in detail, since on a December day those large apartments felt\r\n",
      "uncommonly cold. Scroope and Miss Manners seemed to keep warm, perhaps\r\n",
      "with the inward fires of mutual admiration, but as I had no one to\r\n",
      "admire except Mr. Savage, a temperature of about 35 degrees produced\r\n",
      "its natural effect upon me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At length we took a short cut from the large to the little gallery\r\n",
      "through a warmed and comfortable room, which I understood was Lord\r\n",
      "Ragnallâs study. Halting for a moment by one of the fires, I observed a\r\n",
      "picture on the wall, over which a curtain was drawn, and asked Mr.\r\n",
      "Savage what it might be.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThat, sir,â he replied with a kind of haughty reserve, âis the\r\n",
      "portrait of her future ladyship, which his lordship keeps for his\r\n",
      "private heye.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Miss Manners sniggered, and I said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âOh, thank you. What an ill-omened kind of thing to do!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then, observing through an open door the hall in which my hat had been\r\n",
      "taken from me, I lingered and as the others vanished in the little\r\n",
      "gallery, slipped into it, recovered my belongings, and passed out to\r\n",
      "the garden, purposing to walk there till I was warm again and Scroope\r\n",
      "reappeared. While I marched up and down a terrace, on which, I\r\n",
      "remember, several very cold-looking peacocks were seated, like\r\n",
      "conscientious birds that knew it was their duty to be ornamental,\r\n",
      "however low the temperature, I heard some shots fired, apparently in a\r\n",
      "clump of ilex oaks which grew about five hundred yards away, and\r\n",
      "reflected to myself that they seemed to be those of a small rifle, not\r\n",
      "of a shotgun.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My curiosity being excited as to what was to be an almost professional\r\n",
      "matter, I walked towards the grove, making a circuit through a\r\n",

      "exquisite weapons of their sort and by a great maker. If I muffed the\r\n",
      "thing now, how should I bear the scorn of Charles and the polite\r\n",
      "amusement of his noble master? Almost I prayed that no more pigeons\r\n",

      "skill might be left in doubt.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "with ball. I have no doubt that with a shot-gun your lordship would\r\n",

      "âIâm not so sure,â said Lord Ragnall, laughing pleasantly. âI have an\r\n",

      "weâll see. If you have a day to spare, Mr. Quatermain, we are going to\r\n",
      "shoot through the home coverts to-morrow, which havenât been touched\r\n",

      "I hope heâll come.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This left me no option, and with a sinking heart I had to accept.\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "âJenkins,â he said, addressing the keeper, âdo what Mr. Quatermain has\r\n",
      "said and attend to your own business. Perhaps you are not aware that he\r\n",
      "has shot more lions, elephants, and other big game than you have cats.\r\n",
      "But, however that may be, it is not your place to try to instruct him\r\n",
      "or any of my guests. Now go and see to the beaters.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âBeg pardon, my lord,â ejaculated Jenkins, his face, that was as florid\r\n",
      "as his waistcoat, turning quite pale; âno offence meant, my lord, but\r\n",
      "elephants and lions donât fly, my lord, and those accustomed to such\r\n",
      "ground varmin are apt to shoot low, my lord. Beaters all ready at the\r\n",
      "Hunt Copse, my lord.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus speaking he backed himself out of sight. Lord Ragnall watched him\r\n",
      "go, then said with a laugh:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI apologize to you, Mr. Quatermain. That silly old fool was part of my\r\n",
      "inheritance, so to speak; and the joke of it is that he is himself the\r\n",
      "worst and most dangerous shot I ever saw. However, on the other hand,\r\n",
      "he is the best rearer of pheasants in the county, so I put up with him.\r\n",
      "Come in, now, wonât you? Charles will look after your guns and\r\n",
      "cartridges.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So Scroope and I were taken through a side entrance into the big hall\r\n",
      "and there introduced to the other members of the shooting party, most\r\n",
      "of whom were staying at the castle. They were famous shots. Indeed, I\r\n",
      "had read of the prowess of some of them in _The Field_, a paper that I\r\n",
      "always took in Africa, although often enough, when I was on my distant\r\n",
      "expeditions, I did not see a copy of it for a year at a time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To my astonishment I found that I knew one of these gentlemen. We had\r\n",
      "not, it is true, met for a dozen years; but I seldom forget a face, and\r\n",
      "I was sure that I could not be mistaken in this instance. That mean\r\n",
      "appearance, those small, shifty grey eyes, that red, pointed nose could\r\n",
      "belong to nobody except Van Koop, so famous in his day in South Africa\r\n",
      "in connexion with certain gigantic and most successful frauds that the\r\n",
      "law seemed quite unable to touch, of which frauds I had been one of the\r\n",
      "many victims to the extent of Â£250, a large sum for me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The last time we met there had been a stormy scene between us, which\r\n",
      "ended in my declaring in my wrath that if I came across him on the veld\r\n",
      "I should shoot him at sight. Perhaps that was one of the reasons why\r\n",
      "Mr. van Koop vanished from South Africa, for I may add that he was a\r\n",
      "cur of the first water. I believe that he had only just entered the\r\n",
      "room, having driven over from wherever he lived at some distance from\r\n",
      "Ragnall. At any rate, he knew nothing of my presence at this shoot. Had\r\n",
      "he known I am quite sure that he would have been absent. He turned, and\r\n",
      "seeing me, ejaculated: âAllan Quatermain, by heaven!â beneath his\r\n",
      "breath, but in such a tone of astonishment that it attracted the\r\n",
      "attention of Lord Ragnall, who was standing near.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYes, Mr. van Koop,â I answered in a cheerful voice, âAllan Quatermain,\r\n",
      "no other, and I hope you are as glad to see me as I am to see you.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI think there is some mistake,â said Lord Ragnall, staring at us.\r\n",
      "âThis is Sir Junius Fortescue, who used to be Mr. Fortescue.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIndeed,â I replied. âI donât know that I ever remember his being\r\n",
      "called by that particular name, but I do know that we are oldâfriends.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lord Ragnall moved away as though he did not wish to continue the\r\n",
      "conversation, which no one else had overheard, and Van Koop sidled up\r\n",
      "to me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âMr. Quatermain,â he said in a low voice, âcircumstances have changed\r\n",
      "with me since last we met.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âSo I gather,â I replied; âbut mine have remained much the same, and if\r\n",
      "it is convenient to you to repay me that Â£250 you owe me, with\r\n",
      "interest, I shall be much obliged. If not, I think I have a good story\r\n",
      "to tell about you.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âOh, Mr. Quatermain,â he answered with a sort of smile which made me\r\n",
      "feel inclined to kick him, âyou know I dispute that debt.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âDo you?â I exclaimed. âWell, perhaps you will dispute the story also.\r\n",
      "But the question is, will you be believed when I give the proofs?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âEver heard of the Statute of Limitations, Mr. Quatermain?â he asked\r\n",
      "with a sneer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNot where character is concerned,â I replied stoutly. âNow, what are\r\n",
      "you going to do?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He reflected for a moment, and answered:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âLook here, Mr. Quatermain, you were always a bit of a sportsman, and\r\n",
      "Iâll make you an offer. If I kill more birds than you do to-day, you\r\n",
      "shall promise to hold your tongue about my affairs in South Africa; and\r\n",
      "if you kill more than I do, you shall still hold your tongue, but I\r\n",
      "will pay you that Â£250 and interest for six years.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I also reflected for a moment, knowing that the man had something up\r\n",
      "his sleeve. Of course, I could refuse and make a scandal. But that was\r\n",
      "not in my line, and would not bring me nearer my Â£250, which, if I\r\n",
      "chanced to win, might find its way back to me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAll right, done!â I said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhat is your bet, Sir Junius?â asked Lord Ragnall, who was approaching\r\n",
      "again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIt is rather a long story,â he answered, âbut, to put it shortly,\r\n",
      "years ago, when I was travelling in Africa, Mr. Quatermain and I had a\r\n",
      "dispute as to a sum of Â£5 which he thought I owed him, and to save\r\n",
      "argument about a trifle we have agreed that I should shoot against him\r\n",
      "for it to-day.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIndeed,â said Lord Ragnall rather seriously, for I could see that he\r\n",
      "did not believe Van Koopâs statement as to the amount of the bet;\r\n",
      "perhaps he had heard more than we thought. âTo be frank, Sir Junius, I\r\n",
      "donât much care for bettingâfor thatâs what it comes toâhere. Also I\r\n",
      "think Mr. Quatermain said yesterday that he had never shot pheasants in\r\n",
      "England, so the match seems scarcely fair. However, you gentlemen know\r\n",
      "your own business best. Only I must tell you both that if money is\r\n",
      "concerned, I shall have to set someone whose decision will be final to\r\n",
      "count your birds and report the number to me.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAgreed,â said Van Koop, or, rather, Sir Junius; but I answered\r\n",
      "nothing, for, to tell the truth, already I felt ashamed of the whole\r\n",
      "affair.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As it happened, Lord Ragnall and I walked together ahead of the others,\r\n",
      "to the first covert, which was half a mile or more away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYou have met Sir Junius before?â he said to me interrogatively.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI have met Mr. van Koop before,â I answered, âabout twelve years\r\n",
      "since, shortly after which he vanished from South Africa, where he was\r\n",
      "a well-known and very successfulâspeculator.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âTo reappear here. Ten years ago he bought a large property in this\r\n",
      "neighbourhood. Three years ago he became a baronet.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âHow did a man like Van Koop become a baronet?â I inquired.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âBy purchase, I believe.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âBy purchase! Are honours in England purchased?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYou are delightfully innocent, Mr. Quatermain, as a hunter from Africa\r\n",
      "should be,â said Lord Ragnall, laughing. âYour friendâââ\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âExcuse me, Lord Ragnall, I am a very humble person, not so elevated,\r\n",
      "indeed, as that gamekeeper of yours; therefore I should not venture to\r\n",
      "call Sir Junius, late Mr. van Koop, my friend, at least in earnest.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He laughed again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWell, the individual with whom you make bets subscribed largely to the\r\n",
      "funds of his party. I am telling you what I know to be true, though the\r\n",
      "amount I do not know. It has been variously stated to be from fifteen\r\n",
      "to fifty thousand pounds, and, perhaps by coincidence, subsequently was\r\n",
      "somehow created a baronet.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I stared at him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThatâs all the story,â he went on. âI donât like the man myself, but\r\n",
      "he is a wonderful pheasant shot, which passes him everywhere. Shooting\r\n",
      "has become a kind of fetish in these parts, Mr. Quatermain. For\r\n",
      "instance, it is a tradition on this estate that we must kill more\r\n",
      "pheasants than on any other in the country, and therefore I have to ask\r\n",
      "the best guns, who are not always the best fellows. It annoys me, but\r\n",
      "it seems that I must do what was done before me.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âUnder those circumstances I should be inclined to give up the thing\r\n",
      "altogether, Lord Ragnall. Sport as sport is good, but when it becomes a\r\n",
      "business it grows hateful. I know, who have had to follow it as a trade\r\n",
      "for many years.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThatâs an idea,â he replied reflectively. âMeanwhile, I do hope that\r\n",
      "you will win back yourâÂ£5 from Sir Junius. He is so vain that I would\r\n",
      "gladly give Â£50 to see you do so.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThere is little chance of that,â I said, âfor, as I told you, I have\r\n",
      "never shot pheasants before. Still, Iâll try, as you wish it.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThatâs right. And look here, Mr. Quatermain, shoot well forward of\r\n",
      "them. You see, I am venturing to advise you now, as you advised me\r\n",
      "yesterday. Shot does not travel so fast as ball, and the pheasant is a\r\n",
      "bird that is generally going much quicker than you think. Now, here we\r\n",
      "are. Charles will show you your stand. Good luck to you.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ten minutes later the game began outside of a long covert, all the\r\n",
      "seven guns being posted within sight of each other. So occupied was I\r\n",
      "in watching the preliminaries, which were quite new to me, that I\r\n",
      "allowed first a hare and then a hen pheasant to depart without firing\r\n",
      "at them, which hen pheasant, by the way, curved round and was\r\n",
      "beautifully killed by Van Koop, who stood two guns off upon my right.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âLook here, Allan,â said Scroope, âif you are going to beat your\r\n",
      "African friend you had better wake up, for you wonât do it by admiring\r\n",
      "the scenery or that squirrel on a tree.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So I woke up. Just at that moment there was a cry of âcock forward.â I\r\n",
      "thought it meant a cock pheasant, and was astonished when I saw a\r\n",
      "beautiful brown bird with a long beak flitting towards me through the\r\n",
      "tops of the oak trees.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAm I to shoot at that?â I asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âOf course. It is a woodcock,â answered Scroope.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By this time the brown bird was rocking past me within ten yards. I\r\n",
      "fired and killed it, for where it had been appeared nothing but a cloud\r\n",
      "of feathers. It was a quick and clever shot, or so I thought. But when\r\n",
      "Charles stepped out and picked from the ground only a beak and a head,\r\n",
      "a titter of laughter went down the whole line of guns and loaders.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI say, old chap,â said Scroope, âif you will use No. 3 shot, let your\r\n",
      "birds get a little farther off you.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The incident upset me so much that immediately afterwards I missed\r\n",
      "three easy pheasants in succession, while Van Koop added two to his\r\n",
      "bag.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Scroope shook his head and Charles groaned audibly. Now that I was not\r\n",
      "in competition with his master he had become suddenly anxious that I\r\n",
      "should win, for in some mysterious way the news of that bet had spread,\r\n",
      "and my adversary was not popular amongst the keeper class.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âHere you come again,â said Scroope, pointing to an advancing pheasant.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was an extraordinarily high pheasant, flushed, I think, outside the\r\n",
      "covert by a stop, so high that, as it travelled down the line, although\r\n",
      "three guns fired at it, including Van Koop, none of them seemed to\r\n",
      "touch it. Then I fired, and remembering Lord Ragnallâs advice, far in\r\n",
      "front. Its flight changed. Still it travelled through the air, but with\r\n",
      "the momentum of a stone to fall fifty yards to my right, dead.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThatâs better!â said Scroope, while Charles grinned all over his round\r\n",
      "face, muttering:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWiped his eye that time.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This shot seemed to give me confidence, and I improved considerably,\r\n",
      "though, oddly enough, I found that it was the high and difficult\r\n",
      "pheasants which I killed and the easy ones that I was apt to muff. But\r\n",
      "Van Koop, who was certainly a finished artist, killed both.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At the next stand Lord Ragnall, who had been observing my somewhat\r\n",
      "indifferent performance, asked me to stand back with him behind the\r\n",
      "other guns.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI see the tall ones are your line, Mr. Quatermain,â he said, âand you\r\n",
      "will get some here.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On this occasion we were placed in a dip between two long coverts which\r\n",
      "lay about three hundred yards apart. That which was being beaten proved\r\n",
      "full of pheasants, and the shooting of those picked guns was really a\r\n",
      "thing to see. I did quite well here, nearly, but not altogether, as\r\n",
      "well as Lord Ragnall himself, though that is saying a great deal, for\r\n",
      "he was a lovely shot.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âBravo!â he said at the end of the beat. âI believe you have got a\r\n",
      "chance of winning your Â£5, after all.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When, however, at luncheon, more than an hour later, I found that I was\r\n",
      "thirty pheasants behind my adversary, I shook my head, and so did\r\n",
      "everybody else. On the whole, that luncheon, of which we partook in a\r\n",
      "keeperâs house, was a very pleasant meal, though Van Koop talked so\r\n",
      "continuously and in such a boastful strain that I saw it irritated our\r\n",
      "host and some of the other gentlemen, who were very pleasant people. At\r\n",
      "last he began to patronize me, asking me how I had been getting on with\r\n",
      "my âelephant-pottingâ of late years.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I replied, âFairly well.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThen you should tell our friends some of your famous stories, which I\r\n",
      "promise I wonât contradict,â he said, adding: âYou see, they are\r\n",
      "different from us, and have no experience of big-game shooting.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI did not know that you had any, either, Sir Junius,â I answered,\r\n",
      "nettled. âIndeed, I thought I remembered your telling me in Africa that\r\n",
      "the only big game you had ever shot was an ox sick with the red-water.\r\n",
      "Anyway, shooting is a business with me, not an amusement, as it is to\r\n",
      "you, and I do not talk shop.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this he collapsed amid some laughter, after which Scroope, the most\r\n",
      "loyal of friends, began to repeat exploits of mine till my ears\r\n",
      "tingled, and I rose and went outside to look at the weather.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It had changed very much during luncheon. The fair promise of the\r\n",
      "morning had departed, the sky was overcast, and a wind, blowing in\r\n",
      "strong gusts, was rising rapidly, driving before it occasional scurries\r\n",
      "of snow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âMy word,â said Lord Ragnall, who had joined me, âthe Lake\r\n",
      "covertâthatâs our great stand here, you knowâwill take some shooting\r\n",
      "this afternoon. We ought to kill seven hundred pheasants in it with\r\n",
      "this team, but I doubt if we shall get five. Now, Mr. Quatermain, I am\r\n",
      "going to stand Sir Junius Fortescue and you back in the covert, where\r\n",
      "you will have the best of it, as a lot of pheasants will never face the\r\n",
      "lake against this wind. What is more, I am coming with you, if I may,\r\n",
      "as six guns are enough for this beat, and I donât mean to shoot any\r\n",
      "more to-day.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI fear that you will be disappointed,â I said nervously.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âOh, no, I shaânât,â he answered. âI tell you frankly that if only you\r\n",
      "could have a seasonâs practice, in my opinion you would make the best\r\n",
      "pheasant shot of the lot of us. At present you donât quite understand\r\n",
      "the ways of the birds, thatâs all; also those guns are strange to you.\r\n",
      "Have a glass of cherry brandy; it will steady your nerves.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I drank the cherry brandy, and presently off we went. The covert we\r\n",
      "were going to shoot, into which we had been driving pheasants all the\r\n",
      "morning, must have been nearly a mile long. At the top end it was\r\n",
      "broad, narrowing at the bottom to a width of about two hundred yards.\r\n",
      "Here it ran into a horse-shoe shaped piece of water that was about\r\n",
      "fifty yards in breadth. Four of the guns were placed round the bow of\r\n",
      "this water, but on its farther side, in such a position that the\r\n",
      "pheasants should stream over them to yet another covert behind at the\r\n",
      "top of a slope, Van Koop and I, however, were ordered to take our\r\n",
      "places, he to the right and I to the left, about seventy yards up the\r\n",
      "tongue in little glades in the woodland, having the lake to our right\r\n",
      "and our left respectively. I noticed with dismay that we were so set\r\n",
      "that the guns below us on its farther side could note all that we did\r\n",
      "or did not do; also that a little band of watchers, among whom I\r\n",
      "recognized my friend the gunsmith, were gathered in a place where,\r\n",
      "without interfering with us, they could see the sport. On our way to\r\n",
      "the boat, however, which was to row us across the water, an incident\r\n",
      "happened that put me in very good spirits and earned some applause.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was walking with Lord Ragnall, Scroope and Charles, about sixty yards\r\n",
      "clear of a belt of tall trees, when from far away on the other side of\r\n",
      "the trees came a cry of âPartridges over!â in the hoarse voice of the\r\n",
      "red-waistcoated Jenkins, who was engaged in superintending the driving\r\n",
      "in of some low scrub before he joined his army at the top of the\r\n",
      "covert.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âLook out, Mr. Quatermain, they are coming this way,â said Lord\r\n",
      "Ragnall, while Charles thrust a loaded gun into my hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Another moment and they appeared over the tree-tops, a big covey of\r\n",
      "them in a long, straggling line, travelling at I know not what speed,\r\n",
      "for a fierce gust from the rising gale had caught them. I fired at the\r\n",
      "first bird, which fell at my feet. I fired again, and another fell\r\n",
      "behind me. I snatched up the second gun and killed a third as it passed\r\n",
      "over me high up. Then, wheeling round, I covered the last retreating\r\n",
      "bird, and lo! it too fell, a very long shot indeed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âBy George!â said Scroope, âI never saw that done before,â while\r\n",
      "Ragnall stared and Charles whistled.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But now I will tell the truth and expose all my weakness. The second\r\n",
      "bird was not the one I aimed at. I was behind it and caught that which\r\n",
      "followed. And in my vanity I did not own up, at least not till that\r\n",
      "evening.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The four dead partridgesâthere was not a runner among themâhaving been\r\n",
      "collected amidst many congratulations, we went on and were punted\r\n",
      "across the lake to the covert. As we entered the boat I observed that,\r\n",
      "in addition to the great bags, Charles was carrying a box of cartridges\r\n",
      "under his arm, and asked him where he got it from.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He replied, from Mr. Pophamâthat was the gunsmithâs nameâwho had\r\n",
      "brought it with him in case I should not have enough. I made no remark,\r\n",
      "but as I knew I had quite half of my cartridges left out of the three\r\n",
      "hundred and fifty that I had bought, I wondered to myself what kind of\r\n",
      "a shoot this was going to be.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Well, we took up our stands, and while we were doing so, suddenly the\r\n",
      "wind increased to a tearing gale, which seemed to me to blow from all\r\n",
      "points of the compass in turn. Rooks flying homewards, and pigeons\r\n",
      "disturbed by the beaters were swept over us like drifting leaves; wild\r\n",
      "duck, of which I got one, went by like arrows; the great bare oaks\r\n",
      "tossed their boughs and groaned; while not far off a fir tree was blown\r\n",
      "down, falling with a splash into the water.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âItâs a wild afternoon,â said Lord Ragnall, and as he spoke Van Koop\r\n",
      "came from his stand, looking rather scared, and suggested that the\r\n",
      "shoot should be given up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lord Ragnall asked me what I wished to do. I replied that I would\r\n",
      "rather go on, but that I was in his hands.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI think we are fairly safe in these open places, Sir Junius,â he said;\r\n",
      "âand as the pheasants have been so much disturbed already, it does not\r\n",
      "much matter if they are blown about a bit. But if you are of another\r\n",
      "opinion, perhaps you had better get out of it and stand with the others\r\n",
      "over the lake. Iâll send for my guns and take your place.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On hearing this Van Koop changed his mind and said that he would go on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So the beat began. At first the wind blew from behind us, and pheasants\r\n",
      "in increasing numbers passed over our heads, most of them rather low,\r\n",
      "to the guns on the farther side of the water, who, skilled though they\r\n",
      "were, did not make very good work with them. We had been instructed not\r\n",
      "to fire at birds going forward, so I let these be. Van Koop, however,\r\n",
      "did not interpret the order in the same spirit, for he loosed at\r\n",
      "several, killing one or two and missing others.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThat fellow is no sportsman,â I heard Lord Ragnall remark. âI suppose\r\n",
      "it is the bet.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then he sent Charles to ask him to desist.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Shortly after this the gale worked round to the north and settled\r\n",
      "there, blowing with ever-increasing violence. The pheasants, however,\r\n",
      "still flew forward in the shelter of the trees, for they were making\r\n",
      "for the covert on the hill, where they had been bred. But when they got\r\n",
      "into the open and felt the full force of the wind, quite four out of\r\n",
      "six of them turned and came back at a most fearful pace, many so high\r\n",
      "as to be almost out of shot.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For the next three-quarters of an hour or moreâas I think I have\r\n",
      "explained, the beat was a very long oneâI had such covert shooting as I\r\n",
      "suppose I shall never see again. High above those shrieking trees, or\r\n",
      "over the lake to my left, flashed the wind-driven pheasants in an\r\n",
      "endless procession. Oddly enough, I found that this wild work suited\r\n",
      "me, for as time went on and the pheasants grew more and more\r\n",
      "impossible, I shot better and better. One after another down they came\r\n",
      "far behind me with a crash in the brushwood or a splash in the lake,\r\n",
      "till the guns grew almost too hot to hold. There were so many of them\r\n",
      "that I discovered I could pick my shots; also that nine out of ten were\r\n",
      "caught by the wind and curved at a certain angle, and that the time to\r\n",
      "fire was just before they took the curve. The excitement was great and\r\n",
      "the sport splendid, as anyone will testify who has shot December\r\n",
      "pheasants breaking back over the covert and in a tearing gale. Van Koop\r\n",
      "also was doing very well, but the guns in front got comparatively\r\n",
      "little shooting. They were forced to stand there, poor fellows, and\r\n",
      "watch our performance from afar.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As the thing drew towards an end the birds came thicker and thicker,\r\n",
      "and I shot, as I have said, better and better. This may be judged from\r\n",
      "the fact that, notwithstanding their height and tremendous pace, I\r\n",
      "killed my last thirty pheasants with thirty-five cartridges. The final\r\n",
      "bird of all, a splendid cock, appeared by himself out of nothingness\r\n",
      "when we thought that all was done. I think it must have been flushed\r\n",
      "from the covert on the hill, or been turned back just as it reached it\r\n",
      "by the resistless strength of the storm. Over it came, so high above us\r\n",
      "that it looked quite small in the dark snow-scud.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âToo farâno use!â said Lord Ragnall, as I lifted the gun.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Still, I fired, holding I know not how much in front, and lo! that\r\n",
      "pheasant died in mid air, falling with a mighty splash near the bank of\r\n",
      "the lake, but at a great distance behind us. The shot was so remarkable\r\n",
      "that everyone who saw it, including most of the beaters, who had passed\r\n",
      "us by now, uttered a cheer, and the red-waistcoated old Jenkins, who\r\n",
      "had stopped by us, remarked: âWell, bust me if that bainât a master\r\n",
      "one!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Scroope made me angry by slapping me so hard upon the back that it\r\n",
      "hurt, and nearly caused me to let off the other barrel of the gun.\r\n",
      "Charles seemed to become one great grin, and Lord Ragnall, with a brief\r\n",
      "congratulatory âNever enjoyed a shoot so much in my life,â called to\r\n",
      "the men who were posted behind us to pick up all the dead pheasants,\r\n",
      "being careful to keep mine apart from those of Sir Junius Fortescue.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYou should have a hundred and forty-three at this stand,â he said,\r\n",
      "âallowing for every possible runner. Charles and I make the same\r\n",
      "total.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I remarked that I did not think there were many runners, as the No. 3\r\n",
      "shot had served me very well, and getting into the boat was rowed to\r\n",
      "the other side, where I received more congratulations. Then, as all\r\n",
      "further shooting was out of the question because of the weather, we\r\n",
      "walked back to the castle to tea.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As I emptied my cup Lord Ragnall, who had left the room, returned and\r\n",
      "asked us to come and see the game. So we went, to find it laid out in\r\n",
      "endless lines upon the snow-powdered grass in the quadrangle of the\r\n",
      "castle, arranged in one main and two separate lots.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThose are yours and Sir Juniusâs,â said Scroope. âI wonder which of\r\n",
      "you has won. Iâll put a sovereign on you, old fellow.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThen youâre a donkey for your pains,â I answered, feeling vexed, for\r\n",
      "at that moment I had forgotten all about the bet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I do not remember how many pheasants were killed altogether, but the\r\n",
      "total was much smaller than had been hoped for, because of the gale.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âJenkins,â said Lord Ragnall presently to Red Waistcoat, âhow many have\r\n",
      "you to the credit of Sir Junius Fortescue?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âTwo hundred and seventy-seven, my lord, twelve hares, two woodcocks,\r\n",
      "and three pigeons.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAnd how many to that of Mr. Quatermain?â adding: âI must remind you\r\n",
      "both, gentlemen, that the birds have been picked as carefully as\r\n",
      "possible and kept unmixed, and therefore that the figures given by\r\n",
      "Jenkins must be considered as final.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âQuite so,â I answered, but Van Koop said nothing. Then, while we all\r\n",
      "waited anxiously, came the amazing answer:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âTwo hundred and seventy-seven pheasants, my lord, same number as those\r\n",
      "of Sir Junius, Bart., fifteen hares, three pigeons, four partridges,\r\n",
      "one duck, and a beakâI mean a woodcock.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThen it seems you have won your Â£5, Mr. Quatermain, upon which I\r\n",
      "congratulate you,â said Lord Ragnall.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âStop a minute,â broke in Van Koop. âThe bet was as to pheasants; the\r\n",
      "other things donât count.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI think the term used was âbirds,ââ I remarked. âBut to be frank, when\r\n",
      "I made it I was thinking of pheasants, as no doubt Sir Junius was also.\r\n",
      "Therefore, if the counting is correct, there is a dead heat and the\r\n",
      "wager falls through.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI am sure we all appreciate the view you take of the matter,â said\r\n",
      "Lord Ragnall, âfor it might be argued another way. In these\r\n",
      "circumstances Sir Junius keeps his Â£5 in his pocket. It is unlucky for\r\n",
      "you, Quatermain,â he added, dropping the âmister,â âthat the last high\r\n",
      "pheasant you shot canât be found. It fell into the lake, you remember,\r\n",
      "and, I suppose, swam ashore and ran.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYes,â I replied, âespecially as I could have sworn that it was quite\r\n",
      "dead.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âSo could I, Quatermain; but the fact remains that it isnât there.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIf we had all the pheasants that we think fall dead our bags would be\r\n",
      "much bigger than they are,â remarked Van Koop, with a look of great\r\n",
      "relief upon his face, adding in his horrid, patronizing way: âStill,\r\n",
      "you shot uncommonly well, Quatermain. Iâd no idea you would run me so\r\n",
      "close.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I felt inclined to answer, but didnât. Only Lord Ragnall said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âMr. Quatermain shot more than well. His performance in the Lake covert\r\n",
      "was the most brilliant that I have ever seen. When you went in there\r\n",
      "together, Sir Junius, you were thirty ahead of him, and you fired\r\n",
      "seventeen more cartridges at the stand.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then, just as we turned to go, something happened. The round-eyed\r\n",
      "Charles ran puffing into the quadrangle, followed by another man with a\r\n",
      "dog, who had been specially set to pick my birds, and carrying in his\r\n",
      "hand a much-bedraggled cock pheasant without a tail.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIâve got him, my lord,â he gasped, for he had run very fast; âthe\r\n",
      "little gentâsâI mean that which he killed in the clouds with the last\r\n",
      "shot he fired. It had gone right down into the mud and stuck there. Tom\r\n",
      "and me fished him up with a pole.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lord Ragnall took the bird and looked at it. It was almost cold, but\r\n",
      "evidently freshly killed, for the limbs were quite flexible.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThat turns the scale in favour of Mr. Quatermain,â he said, âso, Sir\r\n",
      "Junius, you had better pay your money and congratulate him, as I do.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI protest,â exclaimed Van Koop, looking very angry and meaner than\r\n",
      "usual. âHow am I to know that this was Mr. Quatermainâs pheasant? The\r\n",
      "sum involved is more than Â£5 and I feel it is my duty to protest.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âBecause my men say so, Sir Junius; moreover, seeing the height from\r\n",
      "which the bird fell, their story is obviously true.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then he examined the pheasant further, pointing out that it appeared to\r\n",
      "have only one woundâa shot through the throat almost exactly at the\r\n",
      "root of the beak, of which shot there was no mark of exit. âWhat sized\r\n",
      "shot were you using, Sir Junius?â he asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNo. 4 at the last stand.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAnd you were using No. 3, Mr. Quatermain. Now, was any other gun using\r\n",
      "No. 3?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All shook their heads.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âJenkins, open that birdâs head. I think the shot that killed it will\r\n",
      "be found in the brain.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jenkins obeyed, using a penknife cleverly enough. Pressed against the\r\n",
      "bone of the skull he found the shot.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNo. 3 it is, sure enough, my lord,â he said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYou will agree that settles the matter, Sir Junius,â said Lord\r\n",
      "Ragnall. âAnd now, as a bet has been made here it had better be paid.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI have not enough money on me,â said Van Koop sulkily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI think your banker is mine,â said Lord Ragnall quietly, âso you can\r\n",
      "write a cheque in the house. Come in, all of you, it is cold in this\r\n",
      "wind.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So we went into the smoking-room, and Lord Ragnall, who, I could see,\r\n",
      "was annoyed, instantly fetched a blank cheque from his study and handed\r\n",
      "it to Van Koop in rather a pointed manner.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He took it, and turning to me, said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI remember the capital sum, but how much is the interest? Sorry to\r\n",
      "trouble you, but I am not very good at figures.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThen you must have changed a good deal during the last twelve years,\r\n",
      "Sir Junius,â I could not help saying. âStill, never mind the interest,\r\n",
      "I shall be quite satisfied with the principal.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So he filled up the cheque for Â£250 and threw it down on the table\r\n",
      "before me, saying something about its being a bother to mix up business\r\n",
      "with pleasure.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I took the draft, saw that it was correct though rather illegible, and\r\n",
      "proceeded to dry it by waving it in the air. As I did so it came into\r\n",
      "my mind that I would not touch the money of this successful scamp, won\r\n",
      "back from him in such a way.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yielding to a perhaps foolish impulse, I said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âLord Ragnall, this cheque is for a debt which years ago I wrote off as\r\n",
      "lost. At luncheon to-day you were talking of a Cottage Hospital for\r\n",
      "which you are trying to get up an endowment fund in this neighbourhood,\r\n",
      "and in answer to a question from you Sir Junius Fortescue said that he\r\n",
      "had not as yet made any subscription to its fund. Will you allow me to\r\n",
      "hand you Sir Juniusâs subscriptionâto be entered in his name, if you\r\n",
      "please?â And I passed him the cheque, which was drawn to myself or\r\n",
      "bearer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He looked at the amount, and seeing that it was not Â£5, but Â£250,\r\n",
      "flushed, then asked:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhat do you say to this act of generosity on the part of Mr.\r\n",
      "Quatermain, Sir Junius?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was no answer, because Sir Junius had gone. I never saw him\r\n",
      "again, for years ago the poor man died quite disgraced. His passion for\r\n",
      "semi-fraudulent speculations reasserted itself, and he became a\r\n",
      "bankrupt in conditions which caused him to leave the country for\r\n",
      "America, where he was killed in a railway accident while travelling as\r\n",
      "an immigrant. I have heard, however, that he was not asked to shoot at\r\n",
      "Ragnall any more.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The cheque was passed to the credit of the Cottage Hospital, but not,\r\n",
      "as I had requested, as a subscription from Sir Junius Fortescue. A\r\n",
      "couple of years later, indeed, I learned that this sum of money was\r\n",
      "used to build a little room in that institution to accommodate sick\r\n",
      "children, which room was named the Allan Quatermain ward.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, I have told this story of that December shoot because it was the\r\n",
      "beginning of my long and close friendship with Ragnall.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When he found that Van Koop had gone away without saying good-bye, Lord\r\n",
      "Ragnall made no remark. Only he took my hand and shook it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I have only to add that, although, except for the element of\r\n",
      "competition which entered into it, I enjoyed this dayâs shooting very\r\n",
      "much indeed, when I came to count up its cost I felt glad that I had\r\n",
      "not been asked to any more such entertainments. Here it is, taken from\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Two and a half hours passed by, most of which time I spent lying down\r\n",
      "to rest and get rid of a headache caused by the continual, rapid firing\r\n",
      "and the roar of the gale, or both; also in rubbing my shoulder with\r\n",
      "ointment, for it was sore from the recoil of the guns. Then Scroope\r\n",
      "appeared, as, being unable to find my way about the long passages of\r\n",
      "that great old castle, I had asked him to do, and we descended together\r\n",
      "to the large drawing-room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a splendid apartment, only used upon state occasions, lighted, I\r\n",
      "should think, with at least two or three hundred wax candles, which\r\n",
      "threw a soft glow over the panelled and pictured walls, the priceless\r\n",
      "antique furniture, and the bejewelled ladies who were gathered there.\r\n",
      "To my mind there never was and never will be any artificial light to\r\n",
      "equal that of wax candles in sufficient quantity. The company was\r\n",
      "large; I think thirty sat down to dinner that night, which was given to\r\n",
      "introduce Lord Ragnallâs future wife to the neighbourhood, whereof she\r\n",
      "was destined to be the leader.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Miss Manners, who was looking very happy and charming in her jewels and\r\n",
      "fine clothes, joined us at once, and informed Scroope that âsheâ was\r\n",
      "just coming; the maid in the cloakroom had told her so.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIs she?â replied Scroope indifferently. âWell, so long as you have\r\n",
      "come I donât care about anyone else.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then he told her she was looking beautiful, and stared at her with such\r\n",
      "affection that I fell back a step or two and contemplated a picture of\r\n",
      "Judith vigorously engaged in cutting off the head of Holofernes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Presently the large door at the end of the room was thrown open and the\r\n",
      "immaculate Savage, who was acting as a kind of master of the\r\n",
      "ceremonies, announced in well-bred but penetrating tones, âLady Longden\r\n",
      "and the Honourable Miss Holmes.â I stared, like everybody else, but for\r\n",
      "a while her ladyship filled my eye. She was an ample and, to my mind,\r\n",
      "rather awful-looking person, clad in black satinâshe was a widowâand\r\n",
      "very large diamonds. Her hair was white, her nose was hooked, her dark\r\n",
      "eyes were penetrating, and she had a bad cold in her head. That was all\r\n",
      "I found time to notice about her, for suddenly her daughter came into\r\n",
      "my line of vision.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Truly she was a lovely girl, or rather, young woman, for she must have\r\n",
      "been two or three-and-twenty. Not very tall, her proportions were\r\n",
      "rounded and exquisite, and her movements as graceful as those of a doe.\r\n",
      "Altogether she was doe-like, especially in the fineness of her lines\r\n",
      "and her large and liquid eyes. She was a dark beauty, with rich brown,\r\n",
      "waving hair, a clear olive complexion, a perfectly shaped mouth and\r\n",
      "very red lips. To me she looked more Italian or Spanish than\r\n",
      "Anglo-Saxon, and I believe that, as a matter of fact, she had some\r\n",
      "southern blood in her on her fatherâs side. She wore a dress of soft\r\n",
      "rose colour, and her only ornaments were a string of pearls and a\r\n",
      "single red camellia. I could see but one blemish, if it were a blemish,\r\n",
      "in her perfect person, and that was a curious white mark upon her\r\n",
      "breast, which in its shape exactly resembled the crescent moon.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The face, however, impressed me with other than its physical qualities.\r\n",
      "It was bright, intelligent, sympathetic and, just now, happy. But I\r\n",
      "thought it more, I thought it mystical. Something that her mother said\r\n",
      "to her, probably about her dress, caused her smile to vanish for a\r\n",
      "moment, and then, from beneath it as it were, appeared this shadow of\r\n",
      "innate mysticism. In a second it was gone and she was laughing again;\r\n",
      "but I, who am accustomed to observe, had caught it, perhaps alone of\r\n",
      "all that company. Moreover, it reminded me of something.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What was it? Ah! I knew. A look that sometimes I had seen upon the face\r\n",
      "of a certain Zulu lady named Mameena, especially at the moment of her\r\n",
      "wonderful and tragic death. The thought made me shiver a little; I\r\n",
      "could not tell why, for certainly, I reflected, this high-placed and\r\n",
      "fortunate English girl had nothing in common with that fate-driven\r\n",
      "Child of Storm, whose dark and imperial spirit dwelt in the woman\r\n",
      "called Mameena. They were as far apart as Zululand is from Essex. Yet\r\n",
      "it was quite sure that both of them had touch with hidden things.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lord Ragnall, looking more like a splendid Van Dyck than ever in his\r\n",
      "evening dress, stepped forward to greet his fiancÃ©e and her mother with\r\n",
      "a courtly bow, and I turned again to continue my contemplation of the\r\n",
      "stalwart Judith and the very ugly head of Holofernes. Presently I was\r\n",
      "aware of a soft voiceâa very rich and thrilling voiceâasking quite\r\n",
      "close to me:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhich is he? Oh! you need not answer, dear. I know him from the\r\n",
      "description.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYes,â replied Lord Ragnall to Miss Holmesâfor it was sheââyou are\r\n",
      "quite right. I will introduce you to him presently. But, love, whom do\r\n",
      "you wish to take you in to dinner? I canâtâyour mother, you know; and\r\n",
      "as there are no titles here to-night, you may make your choice. Would\r\n",
      "you like old Dr. Jeffreys, the clergyman?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNo,â she replied, with quiet firmness, âI know him; he took me in once\r\n",
      "before. I wish Mr. Allan Quatermain to take me in. He is interesting,\r\n",
      "and I want to hear about Africa.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âVery well,â he answered, âand he _is_ more interesting than all the\r\n",
      "rest put together. But, Luna, why are you always thinking and talking\r\n",
      "about Africa? One might imagine that you were going to live there.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âSo I may one day,â she answered dreamily. âWho knows where one has\r\n",
      "lived, or where one will live!â And again I saw that mystic look come\r\n",
      "into her face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I heard no more of that conversation, which it is improbable that\r\n",
      "anyone whose ears had not been sharpened by a lifetime of listening in\r\n",
      "great silences would have caught at all. To tell the truth, I made\r\n",
      "myself scarce, slipping off to the other end of the big room in the\r\n",
      "hope of evading the kind intentions of Miss Holmes. I have a great\r\n",
      "dislike of being put out of my place, and I felt that among all these\r\n",
      "local celebrities it was not fitting that I should be selected to take\r\n",
      "in the future bride on an occasion of this sort. But it was of no use,\r\n",
      "for presently Lord Ragnall hunted me up, bringing the young lady with\r\n",
      "him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âLet me introduce you to Miss Holmes, Quatermain,â he said. âShe is\r\n",
      "anxious that you should take her in to dinner, if you will be so kind.\r\n",
      "She is very interested inâinâââ\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAfrica,â I suggested.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIn Mr. Quatermain, who, I am told, is one of the greatest hunters in\r\n",
      "Africa,â she corrected me, with a dazzling smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I bowed, not knowing what to say. Lord Ragnall laughed and vanished,\r\n",
      "leaving us together. Dinner was announced. Presently we were wending in\r\n",
      "the centre of a long and glittering procession across the central hall\r\n",
      "to the banqueting chamber, a splendid room with a roof like a church\r\n",
      "that was said to have been built in the times of the Plantagenets. Here\r\n",
      "Mr. Savage, who evidently had been looking out for her future ladyship,\r\n",
      "conducted us to our places, which were upon the left of Lord Ragnall,\r\n",
      "who sat at the head of the broad table with Lady Longden on his right.\r\n",
      "Then the old clergyman, Dr. Jeffreys, a pompous and rather frowsy\r\n",
      "ecclesiastic, said grace, for grace was still in fashion at such feasts\r\n",
      "in those days, asking Heaven to make us truly thankful for the dinner\r\n",
      "we were about to consume.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Certainly there was a great deal to be thankful for in the eating and\r\n",
      "drinking line, but of all I remember little, except a general vision of\r\n",
      "silver dishes, champagne, splendour, and things I did not want to eat\r\n",
      "being constantly handed to me. What I do remember is Miss Holmes, and\r\n",
      "nothing but Miss Holmes; the charm of her conversation, the light of\r\n",
      "her beautiful eyes, the fragrance of her hair, her most flattering\r\n",
      "interest in my unworthy self. To tell the truth, we got on âlike fire\r\n",
      "in the winter grass,â as the Zulus say, and when that dinner was over\r\n",
      "the grass was still burning.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I donât think that Lord Ragnall quite liked it, but fortunately Lady\r\n",
      "Longden was a talkative person. First she conversed about her cold in\r\n",
      "the head, sneezing at intervals, poor soul, and being reduced to send\r\n",
      "for another handkerchief after the entrÃ©es. Then she got off upon\r\n",
      "business matters; to judge from the look of boredom on her hostâs face,\r\n",
      "I think it must have been of settlements. Three times did I hear him\r\n",
      "refer her to the lawyersâwithout avail. Lastly, when he thought he had\r\n",
      "escaped, she embarked upon a quite vigorous argument with Dr. Jeffreys\r\n",
      "about church mattersâI gathered that she was âlowâ and he was âhighââin\r\n",
      "which she insisted upon his lordship acting as referee.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âDo try and keep your attention fixed, George,â I heard her say\r\n",
      "severely. âTo allow it to wander when high spiritual affairs are under\r\n",
      "discussion (sneeze) is scarcely reverent. Could you tell the man to\r\n",
      "shut that door? The draught is dreadful. It is quite impossible for you\r\n",
      "to agree with both of us, as you say you do, seeing that metaphorically\r\n",
      "Dr. Jeffreys is at one pole and I am at the other.â (Sneeze.)\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThen I wish I were at the Tropic of Cancer,â I heard him mutter with a\r\n",
      "groan.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In vain; he had to keep his âattention fixedâ on this point for the\r\n",
      "next three-quarters of an hour. So as Miss Manners was at the other\r\n",
      "side of me, and Scroope, unhampered by the presence of any prospective\r\n",
      "mother-in-law, was at the other side of her, for all practical purposes\r\n",
      "Miss Holmes and I were left alone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She began by saying:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI hear you beat Sir Junius Fortescue out shooting to-day, and won a\r\n",
      "lot of money from him which you gave to the Cottage Hospital. I donât\r\n",
      "like shooting, and I donât like betting; and itâs strange, because you\r\n",
      "donât look like a man who bets. But I detest Sir Junius Fortescue, and\r\n",
      "that is a bond of union between us.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI never said I detested him.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNo, but I am sure you do. Your face changed when I mentioned his\r\n",
      "name.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAs it happens, you are right. But, Miss Holmes, I should like you to\r\n",
      "understand that you were also right when you said I did not look like a\r\n",
      "betting man.â And I told her some of the story of Van Koop and the\r\n",
      "Â£250.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAh!â she said, when I had finished, âI always felt sure he was a\r\n",
      "horror. And my mother wanted me, just because he pretended to be low\r\n",
      "churchâbut thatâs a secret.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then I congratulated her upon her approaching marriage, saying what a\r\n",
      "joyful thing it was now and again to see everything going in real,\r\n",
      "happy, storybook fashion: beauty, male and female, united by love, high\r\n",
      "rank, wealth, troops of friends, health of body, a lovely and an\r\n",
      "ancient home in a settled land where dangers do not comeâat\r\n",
      "presentârespect and affection of crowds of dependents, the prospect of\r\n",
      "a high and useful career of a sort whereof the door is shut to most\r\n",
      "people, everything in short that human beings who are not actually\r\n",
      "royalty could desire or deserve. Indeed after my second glass of\r\n",
      "champagne I grew quite eloquent on these and kindred points, being\r\n",
      "moved thereto by memories of the misery that is in the world which\r\n",
      "formed so great a contrast to the lot of this striking and brilliant\r\n",
      "pair.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She listened to me attentively and answered:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThank you for your kind thoughts and wishes. But does it not strike\r\n",
      "you, Mr. Quatermain, that there is something ill-omened in such talk? I\r\n",
      "believe that it does; that as you finished speaking it occurred to you\r\n",
      "that after all the future is as much veiled from all of us asâas the\r\n",
      "picture which hangs behind its curtain of rose-coloured silk in Lord\r\n",
      "Ragnallâs study is from you.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âHow did you know that?â I asked sharply in a low voice. For by the\r\n",
      "strangest of coincidences, as I concluded my somewhat old-fashioned\r\n",
      "little speech of compliments, this very reflection had entered my mind,\r\n",
      "and with it the memory of the veiled picture which Mr. Savage had\r\n",
      "pointed out to me on the previous morning.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI canât say, Mr. Quatermain, but I did know it. You were thinking of\r\n",
      "the picture, were you not?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAnd if I was,â I said, avoiding a direct reply, âwhat of it? Though it\r\n",
      "is hidden from everybody else, he has only to draw the curtain and\r\n",
      "seeâyou.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âSupposing he should draw the curtain one day and see nothing, Mr.\r\n",
      "Quatermain?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThen the picture would have been stolen, that is all, and he would\r\n",
      "have to search for it till he found it again, which doubtless sooner or\r\n",
      "later he would do.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYes, sooner or later. But where? Perhaps you have lost a picture or\r\n",
      "two in your time, Mr. Quatermain, and are better able to answer the\r\n",
      "question than I am.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was silence for a few moments, for this talk of lost pictures\r\n",
      "brought back memories which choked me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then she began to speak again, low, quickly, and with suppressed\r\n",
      "passion, but acting wonderfully all the while. Knowing that eyes were\r\n",
      "on her, her gestures and the expression of her face were such as might\r\n",
      "have been those of any young lady of fashion who was talking of\r\n",
      "everyday affairs, such as dancing, or flowers, or jewels. She smiled\r\n",
      "and even laughed occasionally. She played with the golden salt-cellar\r\n",
      "in front of her and, upsetting a little of the salt, threw it over her\r\n",
      "left shoulder, appearing to ask me if I were a victim of that ancient\r\n",
      "habit, and so on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But all the while she was talking deeply of deep things, such as I\r\n",
      "should never have thought would pass her mind. This was the substance\r\n",
      "of what she said, for I cannot set it all down verbatim; after so many\r\n",
      "years my memory fails me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI am not like other women. Something moves me to tell you so,\r\n",
      "something very real and powerful which pushes me as a strong man might.\r\n",
      "It is odd, because I have never spoken to anyone else like that, not to\r\n",
      "my mother for instance, or even to Lord Ragnall. They would neither of\r\n",
      "them understand, although they would misunderstand differently. My\r\n",
      "mother would think I ought to see a doctorâand if you knew that doctor!\r\n",
      "He,â and she nodded towards Lord Ragnall, âwould think that my\r\n",
      "engagement had upset me, or that I had grown rather more religious than\r\n",
      "I ought to be at my age, and been reflecting too muchâwell, on the end\r\n",
      "of all things. From a child I have understood that I am a mystery set\r\n",
      "in the midst of many other mysteries. It all came to me one night when\r\n",
      "I was about nine years old. I seemed to see the past and the future,\r\n",
      "although I could grasp neither. Such a long, long past and such an\r\n",
      "infinite future. I donât know what I saw, and still see sometimes. It\r\n",
      "comes in a flash, and is in a flash forgotten. My mind cannot hold it.\r\n",
      "It is too big for my mind; you might as well try to pack Dr. Jeffreys\r\n",
      "there into this wineglass. Only two facts remain written on my heart.\r\n",
      "The first is that there is trouble ahead of me, curious and unusual\r\n",
      "trouble; and the second, that permanently, continually, I, or a part of\r\n",
      "me, have something to do with Africa, a country of which I know nothing\r\n",
      "except from a few very dull books. Also, by the wayâthis is a new\r\n",
      "thoughtâthat I have a great deal to do with _you_. That is why I am so\r\n",
      "interested in Africa and you. Tell me about Africa and yourself now,\r\n",
      "while we have the chance.â And she ended rather abruptly, adding in a\r\n",
      "louder voice, âYou have lived there all your life, have you not, Mr.\r\n",
      "Quatermain?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI rather think your mother would be rightâabout the doctor, I mean,â I\r\n",
      "said.\r\n",

      "African quests upon which I had set my mind. I replied that there were\r\n",

      "behind one of the trees came out two tall men dressed in white robes\r\n",

      "picture-book. One was an elderly man with flashing, black eyes, hooked\r\n",
      "nose, and a long grey beard. The other was much younger, but I do not\r\n",
      "remember him so well. They were both brown in colour, but otherwise\r\n",
      "almost like white men; not Negroes by any means. My hoop hit the elder\r\n",

      "picked it up, but did not offer to return it to me. They talked\r\n",
      "together rapidly, and one of them pointed to the moon-shaped birthmark\r\n",
      "which you see I have upon my neck, for it was hot weather, and I was\r\n",
      "wearing a low-cut frock. It was because of this mark that my father\r\n",
      "named me Luna. The elder of the two said in broken English:\r\n",

      "to bed, and put her feet in mustard and water as her cold was so bad,\r\n",
      "which left me wondering whether she meant to carry out this operation\r\n",
      "in bed. I recommended her to take quinine, a suggestion she\r\n",
      "acknowledged rather inconsequently by remarking in somewhat icy tones\r\n",
      "that she supposed I sat up to all hours of the night in Africa. I\r\n",

      "for that member of the British aristocracy irritated me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus we parted, and I never saw her again. She died many years ago,\r\n",
      "poor soul, and I suppose is now freezing her former acquaintances in\r\n",

      "a great deal about the influences of heredity nowadays, but I donât\r\n",

      "âThen you had better put them in the old guardroom, lock them up with\r\n",

      "my lord, I heard a hissing sound in my coat-tail pocket and, putting my\r\n",

      "whom she was talking, and some of the other guests, approached and\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Savage bowed and departed, like a hero to execution, for by his pallor\r\n",
      "I could see that he was in a great fright. When he had gone we set to\r\n",
      "work and cleared a space in the middle of the room, in front of which\r\n",

      "beard, a hooked nose, and flashing, hawk-like eyes. The second was\r\n",
      "shorter and rather stout, also much younger. He had a genial, smiling\r\n",
      "face, small, beady-black eyes, and was clean-shaven. They were very\r\n",

      "side of it as though they meant him to be present. Then they walked\r\n",
      "towards us, each of them carrying an ornamental basket made apparently\r\n",
      "of split reeds, that contained doubtless their conjuring outfit and\r\n",
      "probably the snake which Savage had found in his pocket. To my surprise\r\n",
      "they came straight to me, and, having set down the baskets, lifted\r\n",
      "their hands above their heads, as a person about to dive might do, and\r\n",
      "bowed till the points of their fingers touched the floor. Next they\r\n",
      "spoke, not in Arabic as I had expected that they would, but in Bantu,\r\n",

      "inhaled some of the vapour and blew it out through his nostrils, after\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Suddenly I appeared to stop before a curtain of mist. The mist rolled\r\n",
      "up in front of me and I saw a wild and wonderful scene. There lay a\r\n",
      "lake surrounded by dense African forest. The sky above was still red\r\n",
      "with the last lights of sunset and in it floated the full moon. On the\r\n",
      "eastern side of the lake was a great open space where nothing seemed to\r\n",
      "grow and all about this space were the skeletons of hundreds of dead\r\n",
      "elephants. There they lay, some of them almost covered with grey mosses\r\n",
      "hanging to their bones, through which their yellow tusks projected as\r\n",
      "though they had been dead for centuries; others with the rotting hide\r\n",

      "told the extinct moas did in New Zealand. All my life as a hunter had I\r\n",

      "spot even in a dream.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "See! There was one dying now, a huge gaunt bull that looked as though\r\n",
      "it were several hundred years old. It stood there swaying to and fro.\r\n",
      "Then it lifted its trunk, I suppose to trumpet, though of course I\r\n",
      "could hear nothing, and slowly sank upon its knees and so remained in\r\n",
      "the last relaxation of death.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Almost in the centre of this cemetery was a little mound of\r\n",
      "water-washed rock that had endured when the rest of the stony plain was\r\n",
      "denuded in past epochs. Suddenly upon that rock appeared the shape of\r\n",
      "the most gigantic elephant that ever I beheld in all my long\r\n",
      "experience. It had one enormous tusk, but the other was deformed and\r\n",
      "broken off short. Its sides were scarred as though with fighting and\r\n",
      "its eyes shone red and wickedly. Held in its trunk was the body of a\r\n",
      "woman whose hair hung down upon one side and whose feet hung down upon\r\n",
      "the other. Clasped in her arms was a child that seemed to be still\r\n",
      "living.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The rogue, as a brute of this sort is called, for evidently such it\r\n",
      "was, dropped the corpse to the ground and stood a while, flapping its\r\n",
      "ears. Then it felt for and picked up the child with its trunk, swung it\r\n",
      "to and fro and finally tossed it high into the air, hurling it far\r\n",
      "away. After this it walked to the elephant that I had just seen die,\r\n",
      "and charged the carcass, knocking it over. Then having lifted its trunk\r\n",
      "as though to trumpet in triumph, it shambled off towards the forest and\r\n",
      "vanished.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The curtain of mist fell again and in it, dimly, I thought I sawâwell,\r\n",
      "never mind who or what I saw. Then I awoke.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWell, did you see anything?â asked a chorus of voices.\r\n",

      "statuesque countenance. HarÃ»t received the match with a low bow and\r\n",
      "fired the stuff as before. Then he handed the bowl, from which once\r\n",
      "again the blue smoke curled upwards, to Miss Holmes, and gently and\r\n",
      "gracefully let the antimacassar fall over it and her head, which it\r\n",
      "draped as a wedding veil might do. A few seconds later she threw off\r\n",
      "the antimacassar and cast the bowl, in which the fire was now out, on\r\n",
      "to the floor. Then she stood up with wide eyes, looking wondrous lovely\r\n",
      "and, notwithstanding her lack of height, majestic.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "naked baby which seemed to be carved in yellow ivory, and a chair made\r\n",
      "of ebony inlaid with ivory and seated with string. I stood in front of\r\n",
      "the statue of the Ivory Child. It seemed to come to life and smile at\r\n",
      "me. Round its neck was a string of red stones. It took them from its\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "He shrugged his shoulders and I handed her the parcel, which was neatly\r\n",
      "sewn up. Somebody produced scissors and the stitches were cut. Within\r\n",
      "the linen was a necklace of beautiful red stones, oval-shaped like\r\n",
      "amber beads and of the size of a robinâs egg. They were roughly\r\n",
      "polished and threaded on what I recognized at once to be hair from an\r\n",
      "elephantâs tail. From certain indications I judged these stones, which\r\n",
      "might have been spinels or carbuncles, or even rubies, to be very\r\n",
      "ancient. Possibly they had once hung round the neck of some lady in old\r\n",
      "Egypt. Indeed a beautiful little statuette, also of red stone, which\r\n",
      "was suspended from the centre of the necklace, suggested that this was\r\n",
      "so, for it may well have been a likeness of one of the great gods of\r\n",

      "happened.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That night I did not sleep at all well. It may have been because of the\r\n",

      "with another man whom I disliked and who had defrauded me in the past,\r\n",
      "to say nothing of its physical strain in cold and heavy weather. Or it\r\n",
      "may have been that my imagination was stirred by the arrival of that\r\n",
      "strange pair, HarÃ»t and MarÃ»t, apparently in search of myself, seven\r\n",
      "thousand miles away from any place where they can have known aught of\r\n",
      "an insignificant individual with a purely local repute. Or it may have\r\n",
      "been that the pictures which they showed me when under the influence of\r\n",
      "the fumes of their âtobaccoââor of their hypnotismâtook an undue\r\n",
      "possession of my brain.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Or lastly, the strange coincidence that the beautiful betrothed of my\r\n",
      "host should have related to me a tale of her childhood of which she\r\n",
      "declared she had never spoken before, and that within an hour the two\r\n",
      "principal actors in that tale should have appeared before my eyes and\r\n",
      "hers (for I may state that from the beginning I had no doubt that they\r\n",
      "were the same men), moved me and filled me with quite natural\r\n",
      "foreboding. Or all these things together may have tended to a\r\n",
      "concomitant effect. At any rate the issue was that I could not sleep.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For hour after hour I lay thinking and in an irritated way listening\r\n",
      "for the chimes of the Ragnall stable-clock which once had adorned the\r\n",
      "tower of the church and struck the quarters with a damnable\r\n",
      "reiteration. I concluded that Messrs. HarÃ»t and MarÃ»t were a couple of\r\n",
      "common Arab rogues such as I had seen performing at the African ports.\r\n",
      "Then a quarter struck and I concluded that the elephantsâ cemetery\r\n",
      "which I beheld in the smoke undoubtedly existed and that I meant to\r\n",
      "collar those thousands of poundsâ worth of ivory before I died. Then\r\n",
      "after another quarter I concluded that there was no elephantsâ\r\n",
      "cemeteryâalthough by the way my old friend, Dogeetah or Brother John,\r\n",
      "had mentioned such a thing to meâbut that probably there was a tribe,\r\n",
      "as he had also mentioned, called the Kendah, who worshipped a baby, or\r\n",
      "rather its effigy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Well now, as had already occurred to me, the old Egyptians, of whom I\r\n",
      "was always fond of reading when I got a chance, also worshipped a\r\n",
      "child, Horus the Saviour. And that child had a mother called Isis\r\n",
      "symbolised in the crescent moon, the great Nature goddess, the mistress\r\n",
      "of mysteries to whose cult ten thousand priests were swornâdo not\r\n",
      "Herodotus and others, especially Apuleius, tell us all about her? And\r\n",
      "by a queer coincidence Miss Holmes had the mark of a crescent moon upon\r\n",
      "her breast. And when she was a child those two men, or others very like\r\n",
      "them, had pointed out that mark to each other. And I had seen them\r\n",
      "staring hard at it that night. And in her vapour-invoked dream the\r\n",
      "âHeavenly Child,â _alias_ Horus, or the double of Horus, the _Ka_, I\r\n",
      "think the Egyptians called it, had awakened at the sight of her and\r\n",
      "kissed her and given her the necklace of the goddess, andâall the rest.\r\n",
      "What did it mean?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I went to sleep at last wondering what on earth it _could_ mean, till\r\n",
      "presently that confounded clock woke me up again and I must go through\r\n",
      "the whole business once more.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By degrees, this was towards dawn, I became aware that all hope of rest\r\n",
      "had vanished from me utterly; that I was most painfully awake, and what\r\n",
      "is more, oppressed by a curious fear to the effect that something was\r\n",
      "going to happen to Miss Holmes. So vivid did this fear become that at\r\n",
      "length I arose, lit a candle and dressed myself. As it happened I knew\r\n",
      "where Miss Holmes slept. Her room, which I had seen her enter, was on\r\n",
      "the same corridor as mine though at the other end of it near the head\r\n",
      "of a stair that ran I knew not whither. In my portmanteau that had been\r\n",
      "sent over from Miss Mannersâs house, amongst other things was a small\r\n",
      "double-barrelled pistol which from long habit I always carried with me\r\n",
      "loaded, except for the caps that were in a little leather case with\r\n",
      "some spare ammunition attached to the pistol belt. I took it out,\r\n",
      "capped it and thrust it into my pocket. Then I slipped from the room\r\n",
      "and stood behind a tall clock in the corridor, watching Miss Holmesâs\r\n",
      "door and reflecting what a fool I should look if anyone chanced to find\r\n",
      "me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Half an hour or so later by the light of the setting moon which\r\n",
      "struggled through a window, I saw the door open and Miss Holmes emerge\r\n",
      "in a kind of dressing-gown and still wearing the necklace which HarÃ»t\r\n",
      "and MarÃ»t had given her. Of this I was sure for the light gleamed upon\r\n",
      "the red stones.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Also it shone upon her face and showed me without doubt that she was\r\n",
      "walking in her sleep.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Gliding as silently as a ghost she crossed the corridor and vanished. I\r\n",
      "followed and saw that she had descended an ancient, twisting stairway\r\n",
      "which I had noted in the castle wall. I went after her, my stockinged\r\n",
      "feet making no noise, feeling my way carefully in the darkness of the\r\n",
      "stair, for I did not dare to strike a match. Beneath me I heard a noise\r\n",
      "as of someone fumbling with bolts. Then a door creaked on its hinges\r\n",
      "and there was some light. When I reached the doorway I caught sight of\r\n",
      "the figure of Miss Holmes flitting across a hollow garden that was laid\r\n",
      "out in the bottom of the castle moat which had been drained. The\r\n",
      "garden, as I had observed when we walked through it on the previous day\r\n",
      "on our way to the first covert that we shot, was bordered by a\r\n",
      "shrubbery through which ran paths that led to the back drive of the\r\n",
      "castle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Across the garden glided the figure of Miss Holmes and after it went I,\r\n",
      "crouching and taking cover behind every bush as though I were stalking\r\n",
      "big game, which indeed I was. She entered the shrubbery, moving much\r\n",
      "more swiftly now, for as she went she seemed to gather speed, like a\r\n",
      "stone which is rolled down a hill. It was as though whatever might be\r\n",
      "attracting her, for I felt sure that she was being drawn by something,\r\n",
      "acted more strongly upon her sleeping will as she drew nearer to it.\r\n",
      "For a while I lost sight of her in the shadow of the tall trees. Then\r\n",
      "suddenly I saw her again, standing quite still in an opening caused by\r\n",
      "the blowing down in the gale of one of the avenue of elms that bordered\r\n",
      "the back drive. But now she was no longer alone, for advancing towards\r\n",
      "her were two cloaked figures in whom I recognized HarÃ»t and MarÃ»t.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There she stood with outstretched arms, and towards her, stealthily as\r\n",
      "lions stalking a buck, came HarÃ»t and MarÃ»t. Moreover, between the\r\n",
      "naked boughs of the fallen elm I caught sight of what looked like the\r\n",
      "outline of a closed carriage standing upon the drive. Also I heard a\r\n",
      "horse stamp upon the frosty ground. Round the edge of the little glade\r\n",
      "I ran, keeping in the dark shadow, as I went cocking the pistol that\r\n",
      "was in my pocket. Then suddenly I darted out and stood between HarÃ»t\r\n",
      "and MarÃ»t and Miss Holmes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Not a word passed between us. I think that all three of us\r\n",
      "subconsciously were anxious not to awake the sleeping woman, knowing\r\n",
      "that if we did so there would be a terrible scene. Only after motioning\r\n",
      "to me to stand aside, of course in vain, HarÃ»t and MarÃ»t drew from\r\n",
      "their robes curved and cruel-looking knives and bowed, for even now\r\n",
      "their politeness did not forsake them. I bowed back and when I\r\n",
      "straightened myself those enterprising Easterns found that I was\r\n",
      "covering the heart of HarÃ»t with my pistol. Then with that perception\r\n",
      "which is part of the mental outfit of the great, they saw that the game\r\n",
      "was up since I could have shot them both before a knife touched me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYou have won this time, O Watcher-by-Night,â whispered HarÃ»t softly,\r\n",
      "âbut another time you will lose. That beautiful lady belongs to us and\r\n",
      "the People of the White Kendah, for she is marked with the holy mark of\r\n",
      "the young moon. The call of the Child of Heaven is heard in her heart,\r\n",
      "and will bring her home to the Child as it has brought her to us\r\n",
      "to-night. Now lead her hence still sleeping, O brave and clever one, so\r\n",
      "well named Watcher-by-Night.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then they were gone and presently I heard the sound of horses being\r\n",
      "driven rapidly along the drive.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For a moment I hesitated as to whether I would or would not run in and\r\n",
      "shoot those horses. Two considerations stayed me. The first was that if\r\n",
      "I did so my pistol would be empty, or even if I shot one horse and\r\n",
      "retained a barrel loaded, with it I could only kill a single man,\r\n",
      "leaving myself defenceless against the knife of the other. The second\r\n",
      "consideration was that now as before I did not wish to wake up Miss\r\n",
      "Holmes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I crept to her and not knowing what else to do, took hold of one of her\r\n",
      "outstretched hands. She turned and came with me at once as though she\r\n",
      "knew me, remaining all the while fast asleep. Thus we went back to the\r\n",
      "house, through the still open door, up the stairway straight to her own\r\n",
      "room, on the threshold of which I loosed her hand. The room was dark\r\n",
      "and I could see nothing, but I listened until I heard a sound as of a\r\n",
      "person throwing herself upon the bed and drawing up the blankets. Then\r\n",
      "knowing that she was safe for a while, I shut the door, which opened\r\n",
      "outwards as doors of ancient make sometimes do, and set against it a\r\n",
      "little table that stood in the passage.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Next, after reflecting for a minute, the circumstances being awkward in\r\n",
      "many ways, I went to my room and lit a candle. Obviously it was my duty\r\n",
      "to inform Lord Ragnall of what had happened and that as soon as\r\n",
      "possible. But I had no idea in what part of that huge building his\r\n",
      "sleeping place might be, nor, for patent reasons, was it desirable that\r\n",
      "I should disturb the house and so create talk. In this dilemma I\r\n",
      "remembered that Lord Ragnallâs confidential servant, Mr. Savage, when\r\n",
      "he conducted me to my room on the previous night, which he made a point\r\n",
      "of doing perhaps because he wished to talk over the matter of the\r\n",
      "snakes that had found their way into his pockets, had shown me a bell\r\n",
      "in it which he said rang outside his door. He called it an âemergency\r\n",
      "bell.â I remarked idly that it was improbable that I should have any\r\n",
      "occasion for its use.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWho knows, sir?â said Mr. Savage prophetically. âThere are folk who\r\n",
      "say that this old castle is haunted, which after what I have seen\r\n",
      "to-night I can well believe. If you should chance to meet a ghost\r\n",
      "looking, let us say, like those black villains, Harum and Scarum, or\r\n",
      "whatever they call themselvesâwell, sir, twoâs better company than\r\n",
      "one.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I considered that bell but was loath to ring it for the reasons I have\r\n",
      "given. Then I went outside the room and looked. As I had hoped might be\r\n",
      "the case, there ran the wire on the face of the wall connected along\r\n",
      "its length by other wires with the various rooms it passed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I set to work and followed that wire. It was not an easy job; indeed\r\n",
      "once or twice it reminded me of that story of the old Greek hero who\r\n",
      "found his way through a labyrinth by means of a silken thread. I forget\r\n",
      "whether it were a bull or a lady he was looking for, but with care and\r\n",
      "perseverance he found one or the other, or it may have been both.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Down staircases and various passages I went with my eye glued upon the\r\n",
      "wire, which occasionally got mixed up with other wires, till at length\r\n",
      "it led me through a swing door covered with red baize into what\r\n",
      "appeared to be a modern annexe to the castle. Here at last it\r\n",
      "terminated on the spring of an alarming-looking and deep-throated bell\r\n",
      "that hung immediately over a certain door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On this door I knocked, hoping that it might be that of Mr. Savage and\r\n",
      "praying earnestly that it did not enclose the chaste resting-place of\r\n",
      "the cook or any other female. Too late, I mean after I had knocked, it\r\n",
      "occurred to me that if so my position would be painful to a degree.\r\n",
      "However in this particular Fortune stood my friend, which does not\r\n",
      "always happen to the virtuous. For presently I heard a voice which I\r\n",
      "recognized as that of Mr. Savage, asking, not without a certain quaver\r\n",
      "in its tone,\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWho the devil is that?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âMe,â I replied, being flustered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "ââMeâ wonât do,â said the voice. ââMeâ might be Harum or it might be\r\n",
      "Scarum, or it might be someone worse. Whoâs âMeâ?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAllan Quatermain, you idiot,â I whispered through the keyhole.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAnna who? Well, never mind. Go away, Hanna. Iâll talk to you in the\r\n",
      "morning.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then I kicked the door, and at length, very cautiously, Mr. Savage\r\n",
      "opened it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âGood heavens, sir,â he said, âwhat are you doing here, sir? Dressed\r\n",
      "too, at this hour, and with the handle of a pistol sticking out of your\r\n",
      "pocketâor is itâthe head of a snake?â and he jumped back, a strange and\r\n",
      "stately figure in a long white nightshirt which apparently he wore over\r\n",
      "his underclothing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I entered the room and shut the door, whereon he politely handed me a\r\n",
      "chair, remarking,\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIs it ghosts, sir, or are you ill, or is it Harum and Scarum, of whom\r\n",
      "I have been thinking all night? Very cold too, sir, being afraid to\r\n",
      "pull up the bedclothes for fear lest there might be more reptiles in\r\n",
      "them.â He pointed to his dress-coat hanging on the back of another\r\n",
      "chair with both the pockets turned inside out, adding tragically, âTo\r\n",
      "think, sir, that this new coat has been a nest of snakes, which I have\r\n",
      "hated like poison from a child, and me almost a teetotaller!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYes,â I said impatiently, âitâs Harum and Scarum as you call them.\r\n",
      "Take me to Lord Ragnallâs bedroom at once.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAh! sir, burgling, I suppose, or mayhap worse,â he exclaimed as he\r\n",
      "threw on some miscellaneous garments and seized a life-preserver which\r\n",
      "hung upon a hook. âNow Iâm ready, only I hope they have left their\r\n",
      "snakes behind. I never could bear the sight of a snake, and they seem\r\n",
      "to know itâthe brutes.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In due course we reached Lord Ragnallâs room, which Mr. Savage entered,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âWhat is it, Quatermain?â he asked, sitting up in bed and yawning.\r\n",
      "âHave you had a nightmare?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYes,â I answered, and Savage having left us and shut the door, I told\r\n",
      "him everything as it is written down.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âGreat heavens!â he exclaimed when I had finished. âIf it had not been\r\n",
      "for you and your intuition and courageâââ\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNever mind me,â I interrupted. âThe question isâwhat should be done\r\n",
      "now? Are you going to try to arrest these men, or will youâhold your\r\n",
      "tongue and merely cause them to be watched?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âReally I donât know. Even if we can catch them the whole story would\r\n",

      "suggested.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "In that interval of time I had heard once or twice about Lord Ragnall.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "It ran: âThe bride occasioned some comment by wearing only one\r\n",
      "ornament, although the Ragnall family diamonds, which have not seen the\r\n",
      "light for many years, are known to be some of the finest in the\r\n",
      "country. It was a necklace of what appeared to be large but rather\r\n",
      "roughly polished rubies, to which hung a small effigy of an Egyptian\r\n",
      "god also fashioned from a ruby. It must be added that although of an\r\n",
      "unusual nature on such an occasion this jewel suited her dark beauty\r\n",
      "well. Lady Ragnallâs selection of it, however, from the many she\r\n",
      "possesses was the cause of much speculation. When asked by a friend why\r\n",
      "she had chosen it, she is reported to have said that it was to bring\r\n",
      "her good fortune.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now why did she wear the barbaric marriage gift of HarÃ»t and MarÃ»t in\r\n",
      "preference to all the other gems at her disposal, I wondered. The thing\r\n",
      "was so strange as to be almost uncanny.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The second piece of information concerning this pair reached me through\r\n",
      "the medium of an old _Times_ newspaper which I received over a year\r\n",

      "So thereâs the end to a very curious little story, thought I to myself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Well, during those two years many things befell me. First of all, in\r\n",
      "company with my old friend Sir Stephen Somers, I made the expedition to\r\n",
      "Pongoland in search of the wonderful orchid which he desired to add to\r\n",
      "his collection. I have already written of that journey and our\r\n",
      "extraordinary adventures, and need therefore allude to it no more here,\r\n",
      "except to say that during the course of it I was sorely tempted to\r\n",
      "travel to the territory north of the lake in which the Pongos dwelt.\r\n",
      "Much did I desire to see whether Messrs. HarÃ»t and MarÃ»t would in truth\r\n",
      "appear to conduct me to the land where the wonderful elephant which was\r\n",
      "supposed to be animated by an evil spirit was waiting to be killed by\r\n",
      "my rifle. However, I resisted the impulse, as indeed our circumstances\r\n",
      "obliged me to do. In the end we returned safely to Durban, and here I\r\n",
      "came to the conclusion that never again would I risk my life on such\r\n",
      "mad expeditions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Owing to circumstances which I have detailed elsewhere I was now in\r\n",
      "possession of a considerable sum of cash, and this I determined to lay\r\n",
      "out in such a fashion as to make me independent of hunting and trading\r\n",
      "in the wilder regions of Africa. As usual when money is forthcoming, an\r\n",
      "opportunity soon presented itself in the shape of a gold mine which had\r\n",
      "been discovered on the borders of Zululand, one of the first that was\r\n",
      "ever found in those districts. A Jew trader named Jacob brought it to\r\n",
      "my notice and offered me a half share if I would put up the capital\r\n",
      "necessary to work the mine. I made a journey of inspection and\r\n",
      "convinced myself that it was indeed a wonderful proposition. I need not\r\n",
      "enter into the particulars nor, to tell the truth, have I any desire to\r\n",
      "do so, for the subject is still painful to me, further than to say that\r\n",
      "this Jew and some friends of his panned out visible gold before my eyes\r\n",
      "and then revealed to me the magnificent quartz reef from which, as they\r\n",
      "demonstrated, it had been washed in the bygone ages of the world. The\r\n",
      "news of our discovery spread like wildfire, and as, whatever else I\r\n",
      "might be, everyone knew that I was honest, in the end a small company\r\n",
      "was formed with Allan Quatermain, Esq., as the chairman of the Bona\r\n",
      "Fide Gold Mine, Limited.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oh! that company! Often to this day I dream of it when I have\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Our capital was small, Â£10,000, of which the Jew, who was well named\r\n",
      "Jacob, and his friends, took half (for nothing of course) as the\r\n",
      "purchase price of their rights. I thought the proportion large and said\r\n",
      "so, especially after I had ascertained that these rights had cost them\r\n",
      "exactly three dozen of square-face gin, a broken-down wagon, four cows\r\n",
      "past the bearing age and Â£5 in cash. However, when it was pointed out\r\n",
      "to me that by their peculiar knowledge and genius they had located and\r\n",
      "proved the value of a property of enormous potential worth, moreover\r\n",
      "that this sum was to be paid to them in scrip which would only be\r\n",
      "realizable when success was assured and not in money, after a night of\r\n",
      "anxious consideration I gave way.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Personally, before I consented to accept the chairmanship, which\r\n",
      "carried with it a salary of Â£100 a year (which I never got), I bought\r\n",
      "and paid for in cash, shares to the value of Â£1,000 sterling. I\r\n",
      "remember that Jacob and his friends seemed surprised at this act of\r\n",
      "mine, as they had offered to give me five hundred of their shares for\r\n",
      "nothing âin consideration of the guarantee of my name.â These I\r\n",
      "refused, saying that I would not ask others to invest in a venture in\r\n",
      "which I had no actual money stake; whereon they accepted my decision,\r\n",
      "not without enthusiasm. In the end the balance of Â£4,000 was subscribed\r\n",
      "and we got to work. Work is a good name for it so far as I was\r\n",
      "concerned, for never in all my days have I gone through so harrowing a\r\n",
      "time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We began by washing a certain patch of gravel and obtained results\r\n",
      "which seemed really astonishing. So remarkable were they that on\r\n",
      "publication the shares rose to 10s. premium. Jacob and Co. took\r\n",
      "advantage of this opportunity to sell quite half of their bonus holding\r\n",
      "to eager applicants, explaining to me that they did so not for personal\r\n",
      "profit, which they scorned, but âto broaden the basis of the\r\n",
      "undertaking by admitting fresh blood.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was shortly after this boom that the gravel surrounding the rich\r\n",
      "patch became very gravelly indeed, and it was determined that we should\r\n",
      "buy a small battery and begin to crush the quartz from which the gold\r\n",
      "was supposed to flow in a Pactolian stream. We negotiated for that\r\n",
      "battery through a Cape Town firm of engineersâbut why follow the\r\n",
      "melancholy business in all its details? The shares began to decrease in\r\n",
      "value. They shrank to their original price of Â£1, then to 15s., then to\r\n",
      "10s. Jacob, he was managing director, explained to me that it was\r\n",
      "necessary to âsupport the market,â as he was already doing to an\r\n",
      "enormous extent, and that I as chairman ought to take a âlead in this\r\n",
      "good workâ in order to show my faith in the concern.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I took a lead to the extent of another Â£500, which was all that I could\r\n",
      "afford. I admit that it was a shock to such trust in human nature as\r\n",
      "remained to me when I discovered subsequently that the 1,000 shares\r\n",
      "which I bought for my Â£500 had really been the property of Jacob,\r\n",
      "although they appeared to be sold to me in various other names.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The crisis came at last, for before that battery was delivered our\r\n",
      "available funds were exhausted, and no one would subscribe another\r\n",
      "halfpenny. Debentures, it is true, had been issued and taken up to the\r\n",
      "extent of about Â£1,000 out of the Â£5,000 offered, though who bought\r\n",
      "them remained at the time a mystery to me. Ultimately a meeting was\r\n",
      "called to consider the question of liquidating the company, and at this\r\n",
      "meeting, after three sleepless nights, I occupied the chair.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When I entered the room, to my amazement I found that of the five\r\n",
      "directors only one was present besides myself, an honest old retired\r\n",
      "sea captain who had bought and paid for 300 shares. Jacob and the two\r\n",
      "friends who represented his interests had, it appeared, taken ship that\r\n",
      "morning for Cape Town, whither they were summoned to attend various\r\n",
      "relatives who had been seized with illness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a stormy meeting at first. I explained the position to the best\r\n",
      "of my ability, and when I had finished was assailed with a number of\r\n",
      "questions which I could not answer to the satisfaction of myself or of\r\n",
      "anybody else. Then a gentleman, the owner of ten shares, who had\r\n",
      "evidently been drinking, suggested in plain language that I had cheated\r\n",
      "the shareholders by issuing false reports.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I jumped up in a fury and, although he was twice my size, asked him to\r\n",
      "come and argue the question outside, whereon he promptly went away.\r\n",
      "This incident excited a laugh, and then the whole truth came out. A man\r\n",
      "with coloured blood in him stood up and told a story which was\r\n",
      "subsequently proved to be true. Jacob had employed him to âsaltâ the\r\n",
      "mine by mixing a heavy sprinkling of gold in the gravel we had first\r\n",
      "washed (which the coloured man swore he did in innocence), and\r\n",
      "subsequently had defrauded him of his wages. That was all. I sank back\r\n",
      "in my chair overcome. Then some good fellow in the audience, who had\r\n",
      "lost money himself in the affair and whom I scarcely knew, got up and\r\n",
      "made a noble speech which went far to restore my belief in human\r\n",
      "nature.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He said in effect that it was well known that I, Allan Quatermain,\r\n",

      "I remember her telling me that our great good fortune made her feel\r\n",

      "travelling menagerie that was going to some new encampment. At the head\r\n",
      "of the procession marched a large bull elephant, which I discovered\r\n",
      "afterwards was an ill-tempered brute that had already killed a man and\r\n",
      "should never have been allowed upon the roads. The sight of the pony\r\n",

      "liked bright colours, for some unknown reason seems to have infuriated\r\n",
      "this beast, which trumpeted. The pony becoming frightened wheeled round\r\n",
      "and overturned the cart right in front of the animal, but apparently\r\n",

      "the kerb. It sniffed at the body of the child, feeling it over with the\r\n",
      "tip of its trunk, as though to make sure that it was dead. Next, once\r\n",
      "more it trumpeted triumphantly, and without attempting to harm my wife\r\n",
      "or anybody else, walked quietly past the broken cart and continued its\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âYes, but there is worse to follow. My poor wife went off her head,\r\n",
      "with the shock I suppose, for no physical injury could be found upon\r\n",
      "her. She did not suffer in health or become violent, quite the reverse\r\n",
      "indeed for her gentleness increased. She just went off her head. For\r\n",
      "hours at a time she would sit silent and smiling, playing with the\r\n",
      "stones of that red necklace which those conjurers gave her, or rather\r\n",
      "counting them, as a nun might do with the beads of her rosary. At\r\n",
      "times, however, she would talk, but always to the baby, as though it\r\n",

      "pitiful!\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "hope they gave was that the fit might pass off as suddenly as it had\r\n",

      "intelligence. Thus she took some interest in the sculptures on the\r\n",
      "walls of the temples, about which she had been very fond of reading\r\n",
      "when in health. I remember that only a few days before theâthe\r\n",

      "PhilÃ¦ we came to the temple of Abu Simbel, opposite to which our boat\r\n",
      "was moored. On the following morning we explored the temple at daybreak\r\n",
      "and saw the sun strike upon the four statues which sit at its farther\r\n",

      "that she had left her cabin clad in a fur cloak, evidently some time\r\n",
      "before, as the bed in which she had been lying was quite cold.\r\n",

      "âHave you any theory?â I asked.\r\n",

      "thence fell or threw herself into the Nile, which of course would have\r\n",
      "carried her body away. As you may have heard, the Nile is full of\r\n",

      "English part of the story in which we were concerned, and the threats\r\n",
      "those mysterious persons uttered are the first and greatest of these\r\n",
      "clues. The second is the fact that your hiring of the dahabeeyah\r\n",
      "regardless of expense was known a long time before your arrival in\r\n",
      "Egypt, for I suppose you did so in your own name, which is not exactly\r\n",

      "propensities, which would have made it quite easy for her to be drawn\r\n",
      "ashore under some kind of mesmeric influence. The fourth is that you\r\n",
      "had seen Arabs mounted on camels upon the banks of the Nile. The fifth\r\n",
      "is the heavy sleep you say held everybody on board that particular\r\n",
      "night, which suggests to me that your food may have been drugged. The\r\n",
      "sixth is the apathy displayed by those employed in the search, which\r\n",
      "suggests to me that some person or persons in authority may have been\r\n",
      "bribed, as is common in the East, or perhaps frightened with threats of\r\n",
      "bewitchment. The seventh is that a night was chosen when a wind blew\r\n",
      "which would obliterate all spoor whether of men or of swiftly\r\n",

      "the same time I do not see how it can be set down as more than a\r\n",
      "coincidence, since the elephant which slaughtered your child was\r\n",
      "certainly not that called Jana. To suppose because there is a war\r\n",
      "between an elephant-god and a child-god somewhere in the heart of\r\n",

      "that I have myself bought up at par value a few of the debentures. The\r\n",
      "price of them will pay the lawyers and the liquidation fees; moreover\r\n",
      "they give me a status as a shareholder which will enable me to sue Mr.\r\n",

      "we might advance by whatever road we selected with a small army of\r\n",
      "drilled and disciplined retainers, trusting to force to break a way\r\n",
      "through to the Kendah. Or we might go practically unaccompanied,\r\n",
      "relying on our native wit and good fortune to attain our ends. Each of\r\n",
      "these alternatives had so much to recommend it and yet presented so\r\n",
      "many difficulties, that after long hours of discussion, for this talk\r\n",
      "was renewed again and again, I found it quite impossible to decide upon\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "At length in despair I opened the window and whistled twice on a\r\n",

      "the new corduroy clothes which he had bought upon the strength of his\r\n",
      "return to affluence, for it was raining outside, and squatted himself\r\n",
      "down upon the floor at a little distance. In the shadow of the table\r\n",
      "which cut off the light from the hanging lamp he looked, I remember,\r\n",
      "exactly like an enormous and antique toad. I threw him a piece of\r\n",

      "owing to political events the country happened to be rather disturbed\r\n",
      "at the time, we trekked through Zululand without any great difficulty.\r\n",
      "For here my name was a power in the land and all parties united to help\r\n",
      "me. Thence, too, I managed to dispatch three messengers, half-bred\r\n",
      "border men, lean fellows and swift of foot, forward to the king of the\r\n",
      "Mazitu, as Hans had suggested that I should do, advising him that his\r\n",

      "named Light-in-Darkness and Lord-of-the-Fire, were about to visit him\r\n",
      "again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As I knew we could not take the wagons beyond a certain point where\r\n",
      "there was a river called the Luba, unfordable by anything on wheels, I\r\n",
      "requested him, moreover, to send a hundred bearers with whatever escort\r\n",
      "might be necessary, to meet us on the banks of that river at a spot\r\n",
      "which was known to both of us. These words the messengers promised to\r\n",
      "deliver for a fee of five head of cattle apiece, to be paid on their\r\n",
      "return, or to their families if they died on the road, which cattle we\r\n",
      "purchased and left in charge of a chief, who was their kinsman. As it\r\n",
      "happened two of the poor fellows did die, one of them of cold in a\r\n",
      "swamp through which they took a short cut, and the other at the teeth\r\n",
      "of a hungry lion. The third, however, won through and delivered the\r\n",
      "message.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After resting for a fortnight in the northern parts of Zululand, to\r\n",
      "give time to our wayworn oxen to get some flesh on their bones in the\r\n",
      "warm bushveld where grass was plentiful even in the dry season, we\r\n",
      "trekked forward by a route known to Hans and myself. Indeed it was the\r\n",
      "same which we had followed on our journey from Mazituland after our\r\n",
      "expedition in search for the Holy Flower.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We took with us a small army of Zulu bearers. This, although they were\r\n",
      "difficult to feed in a country where no corn could be bought, proved\r\n",
      "fortunate in the end, since so many of our cattle died from tsetse bite\r\n",
      "that we were obliged to abandon one of the wagons, which meant that the\r\n",
      "goods it contained must be carried by men. At length we reached the\r\n",
      "banks of the river, and camped there one night by three tall peaks of\r\n",
      "rock which the natives called âThe Three Doctors,â where I had\r\n",
      "instructed the messengers to tell the Mazitu to meet us. For four days\r\n",
      "we remained here, since rains in the interior had made the river quite\r\n",
      "impassable. Every morning I climbed the tallest of the âDoctorsâ and\r\n",
      "with my glasses looked over its broad yellow flood, searching the wide,\r\n",
      "bush-clad land beyond in the hope of discovering the Mazitu advancing\r\n",
      "to meet us. Not a man was to be seen, however, and on the fourth\r\n",
      "evening, as the river had now become fordable, we determined that we\r\n",
      "would cross on the morrow, leaving the remaining wagon, which it was\r\n",
      "impossible to drag over its rocky bottom, to be taken back to Natal by\r\n",
      "our drivers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Here a difficulty arose. No promise of reward would induce any of our\r\n",
      "Zulu bearers even to wet their feet in the waters of this River Luba,\r\n",
      "which for some reason that I could not extract from them they declared\r\n",
      "to be _tagati_, that is, bewitched, to people of their blood. When I\r\n",
      "pointed out that three Zulus had already undertaken to cross it, they\r\n",
      "answered that those men were half-breeds, so that for them it was only\r\n",
      "half bewitched, but they thought that even so one or more of them would\r\n",
      "pay the penalty of death for this rash crime.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It chanced that this happened, for, as I have said, two of the poor\r\n",
      "fellows did die, though not, I think, owing to the magical properties\r\n",
      "of the waters of the Luba. This is how African superstitions are kept\r\n",
      "alive. Sooner or later some saying of the sort fulfils itself and then\r\n",
      "the instance is remembered and handed down for generations, while other\r\n",
      "instances in which nothing out of the common has occurred are not\r\n",
      "heeded, or are forgotten.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This decision on the part of those stupid Zulus put us in an awkward\r\n",
      "fix, since it was impossible for us to carry over all our baggage and\r\n",
      "ammunition without help. Therefore glad was I when before dawn on the\r\n",
      "fifth morning the nocturnal Hans crept into the wagon, in the after\r\n",
      "part of which Ragnall and I were sleeping, and informed us that he\r\n",
      "heard menâs voices on the farther side of the river, though how he\r\n",
      "could hear anything above that roar of water passed my comprehension.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At the first break of dawn again we climbed the tallest of the âDoctorâ\r\n",
      "rocks and stared into the mist. At length it rolled away and there on\r\n",
      "the farther side of the river I saw quite a hundred men who by their\r\n",
      "dress and spears I knew to be Mazitu. They saw me also and raising a\r\n",
      "cheer, dashed into the water, groups of them holding each other round\r\n",
      "the middle to prevent their being swept away. Thereupon our silly Zulus\r\n",
      "seized their spears and formed up upon the bank. I slid down the steep\r\n",
      "side of the âGreat Doctorâ and ran forward, calling out that these were\r\n",
      "friends who came.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âFriends or foes,â answered their captain sullenly, âit is a pity that\r\n",
      "we should walk so far and not have a fight with those Mazitu dogs.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Well, I drove them off to a distance, not knowing what might happen if\r\n",
      "the two peoples met, and then went down to the bank. By now the Mazitu\r\n",
      "were near, and to my delight at the head of them I perceived no other\r\n",

      "whom Hans and I had shared many adventures. Through the water he\r\n",
      "plunged with great bounds and reaching the shore, greeted me literally\r\n",
      "with rapture.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âO Macumazana,â he said, âlittle did I hope that ever again I should\r\n",
      "look upon your face. Welcome to you, a thousand welcomes, and to you\r\n",
      "too, Light-in-Darkness, Lord-of-the-Fire, Cunning-one whose wit saved\r\n",

      "âFar away across the Black Water, Babemba,â I answered. âBut here are\r\n",
      "two others in place of them,â and I introduced him to Ragnall and\r\n",
      "Savage by their native names of Igeza and Bena.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He contemplated them for a moment, then said:\r\n",

      "Savage, who was much the better dressed of the two, âis a cock of the\r\n",
      "ashpit arrayed in an eagleâs feathers,â a remark I did not translate,\r\n",
      "but one which caused Hans to snigger vacuously.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While we breakfasted on food prepared by the âCock of the Ashpit,â who\r\n",
      "amongst many other merits had that of being an excellent cook, I heard\r\n",
      "all the news. Bausi the king was dead but had been succeeded by one of\r\n",
      "his sons, also named Bausi, whom I remembered. Beza-Town had been\r\n",
      "rebuilt after the great fire that destroyed the slavers, and much more\r\n",
      "strongly fortified than before. Of the slavers themselves nothing more\r\n",
      "had been seen, or of the Pongo either, though the Mazitu declared that\r\n",
      "their ghosts, or those of their victims, still haunted the island in\r\n",
      "the lake. That was all, except the ill tidings as to two of our\r\n",
      "messengers which the third, who had returned with the Mazitu, reported\r\n",
      "to us.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After breakfast I addressed and sent away our Zulus, each with a\r\n",
      "handsome present from the trade goods, giving into their charge the\r\n",
      "remaining wagon and our servants, none of whom, somewhat to my relief,\r\n",
      "wished to accompany us farther. They sang their song of good-bye,\r\n",
      "saluted and departed over the rise, still looking hungrily behind them\r\n",
      "at the Mazitu, and we were very pleased to see the last of them without\r\n",
      "bloodshed or trouble.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When we had watched the white tilt of the wagon vanish, we set to work\r\n",
      "to get ourselves and our goods across the river. This we accomplished\r\n",
      "safely, for the Mazitu worked for us like friends and not as do hired\r\n",
      "men. On the farther bank, however, it took us two full days so to\r\n",
      "divide up the loads that the bearers could carry them without being\r\n",
      "overladen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At length all was arranged and we started. Of the monthâs trek that\r\n",
      "followed there is nothing to tell, except that we completed it without\r\n",
      "notable accidents and at last reached the new Beza-Town, which much\r\n",
      "resembled the old, where we were accorded a great public reception.\r\n",
      "Bausi II himself headed the procession which met us outside the south\r\n",
      "gate on that very mound which we had occupied in the great fight, where\r\n",
      "the bones of the gallant Mavovo and my other hunters lay buried. Almost\r\n",
      "did it seem to me as though I could hear their deep voices joining in\r\n",
      "the shouts of welcome.\r\n",

      "would give us bearers to carry our goods as far as the confines of\r\n",

      "then their white priests will kill you with their magic. Oh! long\r\n",

      "White Kendah is such a snake as was never seen elsewhere in the world.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThen say to him, sir,â said Savage, when I had translated almost\r\n",

      "promised to provide us with these upon our solemnly undertaking to\r\n",
      "dismiss them at the borders of the desert, âso that they might escape\r\n",
      "our doom,â as he remarked cheerfully.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Four days later we started, accompanied by about one hundred and twenty\r\n",
      "picked men under the command of old Babemba himself, who, he explained,\r\n",
      "wished to be the last to see us alive in the world. This was\r\n",
      "depressing, but other circumstances connected with our start were\r\n",
      "calculated to weigh even more upon my spirit. Thus the night before we\r\n",
      "left Hans arrived and asked me to âwrite a paperâ for him. I inquired\r\n",
      "what he wanted me to put in the paper. He replied that as he was going\r\n",
      "to his death and had property, namely the Â£650 that had been left in a\r\n",
      "bank to his credit, he desired to make a âwhite manâs willâ to be left\r\n",
      "in the charge of Babemba. The only provision of the said will was that\r\n",
      "I was to inherit his property, if I lived. If I died, which, he added,\r\n",
      "âof course you must, Baas, like the rest of us,â it was to be devoted\r\n",
      "to furnishing poor black people in hospital with something comforting\r\n",
      "to drink instead of the âcowâs waterâ that was given to them there.\r\n",
      "Needless to say I turned him out at once, and that testamentary\r\n",
      "deposition remained unrecorded. Indeed it was unnecessary, since, as I\r\n",
      "reminded him, on my advice he had already made a will before we left\r\n",
      "Durban, a circumstance that he had quite forgotten.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The second event, which occurred about an hour before our departure,\r\n",
      "was, that hearing a mighty wailing in the market-place where once Hans\r\n",
      "and I had been tied to stakes to be shot to death with arrows, I went\r\n",
      "out to see what was the matter. At the gateway I was greeted by the\r\n",
      "sight of about a hundred old women plastered all over with ashes,\r\n",
      "engaged in howling their loudest in a melancholy unison. Behind these\r\n",
      "stood the entire population of Beza-Town, who chanted a kind of chorus.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhat the devil are they doing?â I asked of Hans.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âSinging our death-song, Baas,â he replied stolidly, âas they say that\r\n",
      "where we are going no one will take the trouble to do so, and it is not\r\n",
      "right that great lords should die and the heavens above remain\r\n",
      "uninformed that they are coming.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThatâs cheerful,â I remarked, and wheeling round, asked Ragnall\r\n",
      "straight out if he wished to persevere in this business, for to tell\r\n",
      "the truth my nerve was shaken.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI must,â he answered simply, âbut there is no reason why you and Hans\r\n",
      "should, or Savage either for the matter of that.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âOh! Iâm going where you go,â I said, âand where I go Hans will go.\r\n",
      "Savage must speak for himself.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This he did and to the same effect, being a very honest and faithful\r\n",
      "man. It was the more to his credit since, as he informed me in private,\r\n",
      "he did not enjoy African adventure and often dreamed at nights of his\r\n",
      "comfortable room at Ragnall whence he superintended the social\r\n",
      "activities of that great establishment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So we departed and marched for the matter of a month or more through\r\n",
      "every kind of country. After we had passed the head of the great lake\r\n",
      "wherein lay the island, if it really was an island, where the Pongo\r\n",
      "used to dwell (one clear morning through my glasses I discerned the\r\n",
      "mountain top that marked the former residence of the Mother of the\r\n",
      "Flower, and by contrast it made me feel quite homesick), we struck up\r\n",
      "north, following a route known to Babemba and our guides. After this we\r\n",
      "steered by the stars through a land with very few inhabitants, timid\r\n",
      "and nondescript folk who dwelt in scattered villages and scarcely\r\n",
      "understood the art of cultivating the soil, even in its most primitive\r\n",
      "form.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A hundred miles or so farther on these villages ceased and\r\n",
      "thenceforward we only encountered some nomads, little bushmen who lived\r\n",
      "on game which they shot with poisoned arrows. Once they attacked us and\r\n",
      "killed two of the Mazitu with those horrid arrows, against the venom of\r\n",
      "which no remedy that we had in our medicine chest proved of any avail.\r\n",
      "On this occasion Savage exhibited his courage if not his discretion,\r\n",
      "for rushing out of our thorn fence, after missing a bushman with both\r\n",
      "barrels at a distance of five yardsâhe was, I think, the worst shot I\r\n",
      "ever sawâhe seized the little viper with his hands and dragged him back\r\n",
      "to camp. How Savage escaped with his life I do not know, for one\r\n",
      "poisoned arrow went through his hat and stuck in his hair and another\r\n",
      "just grazed his leg without drawing blood.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This valorous deed was of great service to us, since we were able\r\n",
      "through Hans, who knew something of the bushmenâs language, to explain\r\n",
      "to our prisoner that if we were shot at again he would be hung. This\r\n",
      "information he contrived to shout, or rather to squeak and grunt, to\r\n",
      "his amiable tribe, of which it appeared he was a kind of chief, with\r\n",
      "the result that we were no more molested. Later, when we were clear of\r\n",
      "the bushmen country, we let him depart, which he did with great\r\n",
      "rapidity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By degrees the land grew more and more barren and utterly devoid of\r\n",
      "inhabitants, till at last it merged into desert. At the edge of this\r\n",
      "desert which rolled away without apparent limit we came, however, to a\r\n",
      "kind of oasis where there was a strong and beautiful spring of water\r\n",
      "that formed a stream which soon lost itself in the surrounding sand. As\r\n",
      "we could go no farther, for even if we had wished to do so, and were\r\n",
      "able to find water there, the Mazitu refused to accompany us into the\r\n",
      "desert, not knowing what else to do, we camped in the oasis and waited.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As it happened, the place was a kind of hunterâs paradise, since every\r\n",
      "kind of game, large and small, came to the water to drink at night, and\r\n",
      "in the daytime browsed upon the saltish grass that at this season of\r\n",
      "the year grew plentifully upon the edge of the wilderness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Amongst other creatures there were elephants in plenty that travelled\r\n",
      "hither out of the bushlands we had passed, or sometimes emerged from\r\n",
      "the desert itself, suggesting that beyond this waste there lay fertile\r\n",
      "country. So numerous were these great beasts indeed that for my part I\r\n",
      "hoped earnestly that it would prove impossible for us to continue our\r\n",
      "journey, since I saw that in a few months I could collect an enormous\r\n",
      "amount of ivory, enough to make me comparatively rich, if only I were\r\n",
      "able to get it away. As it was we only killed a few of them, ten in all\r\n",
      "to be accurate, that we might send back the tusks as presents to Bausi\r\n",
      "II. To slaughter the poor animals uselessly was cruel, especially as\r\n",
      "being unaccustomed to the sight of man, they were as easy to approach\r\n",
      "as cows. Even Savage slew oneâby carefully aiming at another five paces\r\n",
      "to its left.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For the rest we lived on the fat of the land and, as meat was necessary\r\n",
      "to us, had as much sport as we could desire among the various antelope.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For fourteen days or so this went on, till at length we grew thoroughly\r\n",
      "tired of the business, as did the Mazitu, who were so gorged with flesh\r\n",
      "that they began to desire vegetable food. Twice we rode as far into the\r\n",
      "desert as we dared, for our horses remained to us and had grown fresh\r\n",
      "again after the rest, but only to return without information. The place\r\n",
      "was just a vast wilderness strewn with brown stones beautifully\r\n",
      "polished by the wind-driven sand of ages, and quite devoid of water.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After our second trip, on which we suffered severely from thirst, we\r\n",
      "held a consultation. Old Babemba said that he could keep his men no\r\n",
      "longer, even for us, as they insisted upon returning home, and inquired\r\n",
      "what we meant to do and why we sat here âlike a stone.â I answered that\r\n",
      "we were waiting for some of the Kendah who had bid me to shoot game\r\n",
      "hereabouts until they arrived to be our guides. He remarked that the\r\n",
      "Kendah to the best of his belief lived in a country that was still\r\n",
      "hundreds of miles away and that, as they did not know of our presence,\r\n",
      "any communication across the desert being impossible, our proceedings\r\n",
      "seemed to be foolish.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I retorted that I was not quite so sure of this, since the Kendah\r\n",
      "seemed to have remarkable ways of acquiring information.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThen, Macumazana, I fear that you will have to wait by yourselves\r\n",
      "until you discover which of us is right,â he said stolidly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Turning to Ragnall, I asked him what he would do, pointing out that to\r\n",
      "journey into the desert meant death, especially as we did not know\r\n",
      "whither we were going, and that to return alone, without the stores\r\n",
      "which we must abandon, through the country of the bushmen to\r\n",
      "Mazituland, would also be a risky proceeding. However, it was for him\r\n",
      "to decide.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now he grew much perturbed. Taking me apart again he dwelt earnestly\r\n",
      "upon his secret reasons for wishing to visit these Kendah, with which\r\n",
      "of course I was already acquainted, as indeed was Savage.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI desire to stay here,â he ended.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhich means that we must all stay, Ragnall, since Savage will not\r\n",
      "desert you. Nor will Hans desert me although he thinks us mad. He\r\n",
      "points out that I came to seek ivory and here about is ivory in plenty\r\n",
      "for the trouble of taking.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI might remain alone, Quatermainâââ he began, but I looked at him in\r\n",
      "such a way that he never finished the sentence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ultimately we came to a compromise. Babemba, on behalf of the Mazitu,\r\n",
      "agreed to wait three more days. If nothing happened during that period\r\n",
      "we on our part agreed to return with them to a stretch of well-watered\r\n",
      "bush about fifty miles behind us, which we knew swarmed with elephants,\r\n",
      "that by now were growing shy of approaching our oasis where there was\r\n",
      "so much noise and shooting. There we would kill as much ivory as we\r\n",
      "could carry, an operation in which they were willing to assist for the\r\n",
      "fun of it, and then go back with them to Mazituland.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The three days went by and with every hour that passed my spirits rose,\r\n",
      "as did those of Savage and Hans, while Lord Ragnall became more and\r\n",
      "more depressed. The third afternoon was devoted to a jubilant packing\r\n",
      "of loads, for in accordance with the terms of our bargain we were to\r\n",
      "start backwards on our spoor at dawn upon the morrow. Most happily did\r\n",
      "I lay myself down to sleep in my little bough shelter that night,\r\n",
      "feeling that at last I was rid of an uncommonly awkward adventure. If I\r\n",
      "thought that we could do any good by staying on, it would have been\r\n",
      "another matter. But as I was certain that there was no earthly chance\r\n",
      "of our finding among the Kendahâif ever we reached themâthe lady who\r\n",
      "had tumbled in the Nile in Egypt, well, I was glad that Providence had\r\n",
      "been so good as to make it impossible for us to commit suicide by\r\n",
      "thirst in a desert, or otherwise. For, notwithstanding my former\r\n",
      "reasonings to the contrary, I was now convinced that this was what had\r\n",
      "happened to poor Ragnallâs wife.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That, however, was just what Providence had not done. In the middle of\r\n",
      "the night, to be precise, at exactly two in the morning, I was awakened\r\n",
      "by Hans, who slept at the back of my shanty, into which he had crept\r\n",
      "through a hole in the faggots, exclaiming in a frightened voice,\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âOpen your eyes and look, Baas. There are two _spooks_ waiting to see\r\n",
      "you outside, Baas.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Very cautiously I lifted myself a little and stared out into the\r\n",
      "moonlight. There, seated about five paces from the open end of the hut\r\n",
      "were the âspooksâ sure enough, two white-robed figures squatting silent\r\n",
      "and immovable on the ground. At first I was frightened. Then I\r\n",
      "bethought me of thieves and felt for my Colt pistol under the rug that\r\n",
      "served me as a pillow. As I got hold of the handle, however, a deep\r\n",
      "voice said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIs it your custom, O Macumazana, Watcher-by-Night, to receive guests\r\n",
      "with bullets?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now thought I to myself, who is there in the world who could see a man\r\n",
      "catch hold of the handle of a pistol in the recesses of a dark place\r\n",
      "and under a blanket at night, except the owner of that voice which I\r\n",
      "seemed to remember hearing in a certain drawing-room in England?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYes, HarÃ»t,â I answered with an unconcerned yawn, âwhen the guests\r\n",
      "come in such a doubtful fashion and in the middle of the night. But as\r\n",
      "you are here at last, will you be so good as to tell us why you have\r\n",
      "kept us waiting all this time? Is that your way of fulfilling an\r\n",
      "engagement?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âO Lord Macumazana,â answered HarÃ»t, for of course it was he, in quite\r\n",
      "a perturbed tone, âI offer to you our humble apologies. The truth is\r\n",
      "that when we heard of your arrival at Beza-Town we started, or tried to\r\n",
      "start, from hundreds of miles away to keep our tryst with you here as\r\n",
      "we promised we would do. But we are mortal, Macumazana, and accidents\r\n",
      "intervened. Thus, when we had ascertained the weight of your baggage,\r\n",
      "camels had to be collected to carry it, which were grazing at a\r\n",
      "distance. Also it was necessary to send forward to dig out a certain\r\n",
      "well in the desert where they must drink. Hence the delay. Still, you\r\n",
      "will admit that we have arrived in time, five, or at any rate four\r\n",
      "hours before the rising of that sun which was to light you on your\r\n",
      "homeward way.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYes, you have, O Prophets, or O Liars, whichever you may be,â I\r\n",
      "exclaimed with pardonable exasperation, for really their knowledge of\r\n",
      "my private affairs, however obtained, was enough to anger a saint. âSo\r\n",
      "as you are here at last, come in and have a drink, for whether you are\r\n",
      "men or devils, you must be cold out there in the damp.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In they came accordingly, and, not being Mohammedans, partook of a tot\r\n",
      "of square-face from a bottle which I kept locked in a box to put Hans\r\n",
      "beyond the reach of temptation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âTo your health, HarÃ»t and MarÃ»t,â I said, drinking a little out of the\r\n",
      "pannikin and giving the rest to Hans, who gulped the fiery liquor down\r\n",
      "with a smack of his lips. For I will admit that I joined in this unholy\r\n",
      "midnight potation to gain time for thought and to steady my nerve.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âTo your health, O Lord Macumazana,â the pair answered as they\r\n",
      "swallowed their tots, which I had made pretty stiff, and set down their\r\n",
      "pannikins in front of them with as much reverence as though these had\r\n",
      "been holy vessels.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNow,â I said, throwing a blanket over my shoulders, for the air was\r\n",
      "chilly, ânow let us talk,â and taking the lantern which Hans had\r\n",
      "thoughtfully lighted, I held it up and contemplated them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "that strange âtobaccoâ of theirs really give them some clairvoyant\r\n",
      "power, I wondered, or had they other secret methods of obtaining news?\r\n",
      "I glanced at poor Savage and perceived that he too felt as I did, for\r\n",
      "he had turned quite pale beneath his tan. Even Hans was affected, for\r\n",
      "he whispered to me in Dutch: âThese are not men; these are devils,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Only Ragnall sat stern, silent, and apparently quite unmoved. Indeed\r\n",
      "there was something almost sphinx-like about the set and expression of\r\n",
      "his handsome face. Moreover, I felt sure that HarÃ»t and MarÃ»t\r\n",
      "recognized the manâs strength and determination and that he was one\r\n",
      "with whom they must reckon seriously. Beneath all their smiles and\r\n",
      "courtesies I could read this knowledge in their eyes; also that it was\r\n",
      "causing them grave anxiety. It was as though they knew that here was\r\n",
      "one against whom their power had no avail, whose fate was the master of\r\n",
      "their fate. In a sense HarÃ»t admitted this to me, for suddenly he\r\n",
      "looked up and said in a changed voice and in Bantu:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYou are a good reader of hearts, O Macumazana, almost as good as I am.\r\n",
      "But remember that there is One Who writes upon the book of the heart,\r\n",
      "Who is the Lord of us who do but read, and that what He writes, that\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âQuite so,â I replied coolly, âand that is why I am going with you to\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âSo it is and so let it be,â he answered. âAnd now, Lords, are you\r\n",
      "ready to start? For long is the road and who knows what awaits us ere\r\n",
      "we see its end?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYes,â I replied, âlong is the road of life and who knows what awaits\r\n",

      "Three hours later I halted the splendid white riding-camel upon which I\r\n",
      "was mounted, and looked back from the crest of a wave of the desert.\r\n",
      "There far behind us on the horizon, by the help of my glasses, I could\r\n",
      "make out the site of the camp we had left and even the tall ant-hill\r\n",
      "whence I had gazed in the moonlight at our mysterious escort which\r\n",
      "seemed to have sprung from the desert as though by magic.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was the manner of our march: A mile or so ahead of us went a\r\n",
      "picket of eight or ten men mounted on the swiftest beasts, doubtless to\r\n",
      "give warning of any danger. Next, three or four hundred yards away,\r\n",
      "followed a body of about fifty Kendah, travelling in a double line, and\r\n",
      "behind these the baggage men, mounted like everyone else, and leading\r\n",
      "behind them strings of camels laden with water, provisions, tents of\r\n",
      "skin and all our goods, including the fifty rifles and the ammunition\r\n",
      "that Ragnall had brought from England. Then came we three white men and\r\n",
      "Hans, each of us riding as swift and fine a camel as Africa can breed.\r\n",
      "On our right at a distance of about half a mile, and also on our left,\r\n",
      "travelled other bodies of the Kendah of the same numerical strength as\r\n",
      "that ahead, while the rear was brought up by the remainder of the\r\n",
      "company who drove a number of spare camels.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus we journeyed in the centre of a square whence any escape would\r\n",
      "have been impossible, for I forgot to say that our keepers HarÃ»t and\r\n",
      "MarÃ»t rode exactly behind us, at such a distance that we could call to\r\n",
      "them if we wished.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At first I found this method of travelling very tiring, as does\r\n",
      "everyone who is quite unaccustomed to camel-back. Indeed the swing and\r\n",
      "the jolt of the swift creature beneath me seemed to wrench my bones\r\n",
      "asunder to such an extent that at the beginning I had once or twice to\r\n",
      "be lifted from the saddle when, after hours of torture, at length we\r\n",
      "camped for the night. Poor Savage suffered even more than I did, for\r\n",
      "the motion reduced him to a kind of jelly. Ragnall, however, who I\r\n",
      "think had ridden camels before, felt little inconvenience, and the same\r\n",
      "may be said of Hans, who rode in all sorts of positions, sometimes\r\n",
      "sideways like a lady, and at others kneeling on the saddle like a\r\n",
      "monkey on a barrel-organ. Also, being very light and tough as rimpis,\r\n",
      "the swaying motion did not seem to affect him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By degrees all these troubles left us to such an extent that I could\r\n",
      "cover my fifty miles a day, more or less, without even feeling tired.\r\n",
      "Indeed I grew to like the life in that pure and sparkling desert air,\r\n",
      "perhaps because it was so restful. Day after day we journeyed on across\r\n",
      "the endless, sandy plain, watching the sun rise, watching it grow high,\r\n",
      "watching it sink again. Night after night we ate our simple food with\r\n",
      "appetite and slept beneath the glittering stars till the new dawn broke\r\n",
      "in glory from the bosom of the immeasurable East.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We spoke but little during all this time. It was as though the silence\r\n",
      "of the wilderness had got hold of us and sealed our lips. Or perhaps\r\n",
      "each of us was occupied with his own thoughts. At any rate I know that\r\n",
      "for my part I seemed to live in a kind of dreamland, thinking of the\r\n",
      "past, reflecting much upon the innumerable problems of this passing\r\n",
      "show called life, but not paying much heed to the future. What did the\r\n",
      "future matter to me, who did not know whether I should have a share of\r\n",
      "it even for another month, or week, or day, surrounded as I was by the\r\n",
      "shadow of death? No, I troubled little as to any earthly future,\r\n",
      "although I admit that in this oasis of calm I reflected upon that state\r\n",
      "where past, present and future will all be one; also that those\r\n",
      "reflections, which were in their essence a kind of unshaped prayer,\r\n",
      "brought much calm to my spirit.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With the regiment of escort we had practically no communication; I\r\n",
      "think that they had been forbidden to talk to us. They were a very\r\n",
      "silent set of men, finely-made, capable persons, of an Arab type, light\r\n",
      "rather than dark in colour, who seemed for the most part to communicate\r\n",
      "with each other by signs or in low-muttered words. Evidently they\r\n",
      "looked upon HarÃ»t and MarÃ»t with great veneration, for any order which\r\n",
      "either of these brethren gave, if they were brethren, was obeyed\r\n",
      "without dispute or delay. Thus, when I happened to mention that I had\r\n",
      "lost a pocket-knife at one of our camping-places two daysâ journey\r\n",
      "back, three of them, much against my wish, were ordered to return to\r\n",
      "look for it, and did so, making no question. Eight days later they\r\n",
      "rejoined us much exhausted and having lost a camel, but with the knife,\r\n",
      "which they handed to me with a low bow; and I confess that I felt\r\n",
      "ashamed to take the thing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nor did we exchange many further confidences with HarÃ»t and MarÃ»t. Up\r\n",
      "to the time of our arrival at the boundaries of the Kendah country, our\r\n",
      "only talk with them was of the incidents of travel, of where we should\r\n",
      "camp, of how far it might be to the next water, for water-holes or old\r\n",
      "wells existed in this desert, of such birds as we saw, and so forth. As\r\n",
      "to other and more important matters a kind of truce seemed to prevail.\r\n",
      "Still, I observed that they were always studying us, and especially\r\n",
      "Lord Ragnall, who rode on day after day, self-absorbed and staring\r\n",
      "straight in front of him as though he looked at something we could not\r\n",
      "see.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus we covered hundreds of miles, not less than five hundred at the\r\n",
      "least, reckoning our progress at only thirty miles a day, including\r\n",
      "stoppages. For occasionally we stopped at the water-holes or small\r\n",
      "oases, where the camels drank and rested. Indeed, these were so\r\n",
      "conveniently arranged that I came to the conclusion that once there\r\n",
      "must have been some established route running across these wastelands\r\n",
      "to the south, of which the traditional knowledge remained with the\r\n",
      "Kendah people. If so, it had not been used for generations, for save\r\n",
      "those of one or two that had died on the outward march, we saw no\r\n",
      "skeletons of camels or other beasts, or indeed any sign of man. The\r\n",
      "place was an absolute wilderness where nothing lived except a few small\r\n",
      "mammals at the oases and the birds that passed over it in the air on\r\n",
      "their way to more fertile regions. Of these, by the way, I saw many\r\n",
      "that are known both to Europe and Africa, especially ducks and cranes;\r\n",
      "also storks that, for aught I can say, may have come from far-off,\r\n",
      "homely Holland.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At last the character of the country began to change. Grass appeared on\r\n",
      "its lower-lying stretches, then bushes, then occasional trees and among\r\n",
      "the trees a few buck. Halting the caravan I crept out and shot two of\r\n",
      "these buck with a right and left, a feat that caused our grave escort\r\n",
      "to stare in a fashion which showed me that they had never seen anything\r\n",
      "of the sort done before.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That night, while we were eating the venison with relish, since it was\r\n",
      "the first fresh meat that we had tasted for many a day, I observed that\r\n",
      "the disposition of our camp was different from its common form. Thus it\r\n",
      "was smaller and placed on an eminence. Also the camels were not allowed\r\n",
      "to graze where they would as usual, but were kept within a limited area\r\n",
      "while their riders were arranged in groups outside of them. Further,\r\n",
      "the stores were piled near our tents, in the centre, with guards set\r\n",
      "over them. I asked HarÃ»t and MarÃ»t, who were sharing our meal, the\r\n",
      "reason of these alterations.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIt is because we are on the borders of the Kendah country,â answered\r\n",
      "old HarÃ»t. âFour daysâ more march will bring us there, Macumazana.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThen why should you take precautions against your own people? Surely\r\n",
      "they will welcome you.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWith spears perhaps. Macumazana, learn that the Kendah are not one but\r\n",
      "two people. As you may have heard before, we are the White Kendah, but\r\n",
      "there are also Black Kendah who outnumber us many times over, though in\r\n",
      "the beginning we from the north conquered them, or so says our history.\r\n",
      "The White Kendah have their own territory; but as there is no other\r\n",
      "road, to reach it we must pass through that of the Black Kendah, where\r\n",
      "it is always possible that we may be attacked, especially as we bring\r\n",
      "strangers into the land.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âHow is it then that the Black Kendah allow you to live at all, HarÃ»t,\r\n",
      "if they are so much the more numerous?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âBecause of fear, Macumazana. They fear our wisdom and the decrees of\r\n",
      "the Heavenly Child spoken through the mouth of its oracle, which, if it\r\n",
      "is offended, can bring a curse upon them. Still, if they find us\r\n",
      "outside our borders they may kill us, if they can, as we may kill them\r\n",
      "if we find them within our borders.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIndeed, HarÃ»t. Then it looks to me as though there were a war breeding\r\n",
      "between you.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âA war is breeding, Macumazana, the last great war in which either the\r\n",
      "White Kendah or the Black Kendah must perish. Or perhaps both will die\r\n",
      "together. Maybe that is the real reason why we have asked you to be our\r\n",
      "guest, Macumazana,â and with their usual courteous bows, both of them\r\n",
      "rose and departed before I could reply.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYou see how it stands,â I said to Ragnall. âWe have been brought here\r\n",
      "to fight for our friends, HarÃ»t, MarÃ»t and Co., against their\r\n",

      "That night passed in safety. Next day we marched before the dawn,\r\n",
      "passing through country that grew continually better watered and more\r\n",
      "fertile, though it was still open plain but sloping upwards ever more\r\n",
      "steeply. On this plain I saw herds of antelopes and what in the\r\n",
      "distance looked like cattle, but no human being. Before evening we\r\n",
      "camped where there was good water and plenty of food for the camels.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While the camp was being set HarÃ»t came and invited us to follow him to\r\n",
      "the outposts, whence he said we should see a view. We walked with him,\r\n",
      "a matter of not more than a quarter of a mile to the head of that rise\r\n",
      "up which we had been travelling all day, and thence perceived one of\r\n",
      "the most glorious prospects on which my eyes have fallen in all great\r\n",
      "Africa. From where we stood the land sloped steeply for a matter of ten\r\n",
      "or fifteen miles, till finally the fall ended in a vast plain like to\r\n",
      "the bottom of a gigantic saucer, that I presume in some far time of the\r\n",
      "worldâs history was once an enormous lake. A river ran east and west\r\n",
      "across this plain and into it fell tributaries. Far beyond this river\r\n",
      "the contours of the country rose again till, many, many miles away,\r\n",
      "there appeared a solitary hill, tumulus-shaped, which seemed to be\r\n",
      "covered with bush.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Beyond and surrounding this hill was more plain which with the aid of\r\n",
      "my powerful glasses was, we could see, bordered at last by a range of\r\n",
      "great mountains, looking like a blue line pencilled across the northern\r\n",
      "distance. To the east and west the plain seemed to be illimitable.\r\n",
      "Obviously its soil was of a most fertile character and supported\r\n",
      "numbers of inhabitants, for everywhere we could see their kraals or\r\n",
      "villages. Much of it to the west, however, was covered with dense\r\n",
      "forest with, to all appearance, a clearing in its midst.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âBehold the land of the Kendah,â said HarÃ»t. âOn this side of the River\r\n",

      "in yonder forest to make report of our arrival. Return to camp,\r\n",
      "Macumazana, and eat, for we must march with the rising of the moon.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As soon as the moon rose we marched accordingly, although the camels,\r\n",
      "many of which were much worn with the long journey, scarcely had been\r\n",
      "given time to fill themselves and none to rest. All night we marched\r\n",
      "down the long slope, only halting for half an hour before daylight to\r\n",
      "eat something and rearrange the loads on the baggage beasts, which now,\r\n",
      "I noticed, were guarded with extra care. When we were starting again\r\n",

      "âOr his worshippers on two legs,â I suggested, to which his only reply\r\n",
      "was a nod.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So we got our repeating rifles, some of the first that were ever made,\r\n",
      "serviceable but rather complicated weapons that fired five cartridges.\r\n",
      "Hans, however, with my permission, armed himself with the little Purdey\r\n",
      "piece that was named âIntombi,â the singe-barrelled, muzzle-loading gun\r\n",
      "which had done me so much service in earlier days, and even on my last\r\n",
      "journey to Pongoland. He said that he was accustomed to it and did not\r\n",
      "understand these new-fangled breechloaders, also that it was âlucky.â I\r\n",
      "consented as I did not think that it made much difference with what\r\n",
      "kind of rifle Hans was provided. As a marksman he had this peculiarity:\r\n",
      "up to a hundred yards or so he was an excellent shot, but beyond that\r\n",
      "distance no good at all.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A quarter of an hour later, as the dawn was breaking, we passed through\r\n",
      "a kind of _nek_ of rough stones bordering the flat land, and emerged\r\n",
      "into a compact body on to the edge of the grassy plain. Here the word\r\n",
      "was given to halt for a reason that became clear to me so soon as I was\r\n",
      "out of the rocks. For there, marching rapidly, not half a mile away,\r\n",
      "were some five hundred white-robed men. A large proportion of these\r\n",
      "were mounted, the best being foot-soldiers, of whom more were running\r\n",
      "up every minute, appearing out of bush that grew upon the hill-side,\r\n",
      "apparently to dispute our passage. These people, who were black-faced\r\n",
      "with fuzzy hair upon which they wore no head-dress, all seemed to be\r\n",
      "armed with spears.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Presently from out of the mass of them two horsemen dashed forward, one\r\n",
      "of whom bore a white flag in token that they came to parley. Our\r\n",
      "advance guard allowed them to pass and they galloped on, dodging in and\r\n",
      "out between the camels with wonderful skill till at length they came to\r\n",
      "where we were with HarÃ»t and MarÃ»t, and pulling up their horses so\r\n",
      "sharply that the animals almost sat down on their haunches, saluted by\r\n",

      "black in colour with a negroid cast of countenance and long frizzled\r\n",
      "hair which hung down on to their shoulders. Their clothing was light,\r\n",
      "consisting of hide riding breeches that resembled bathing drawers,\r\n",
      "sandals, and an arrangement of triple chains which seemed to be made of\r\n",

      "belt. This, as I ascertained afterwards, was the regulation cavalry\r\n",

      "upon a peaceful errand. It was necessary that we should convey the\r\n",
      "white lords to make an offering to the Child, and this was the only\r\n",
      "road by which we could lead them to the Holy Mount, since they come\r\n",

      "lifting of the spears of all our escort that were within hearing,\r\n",

      "afraid and they shrank a little. Evidently the âthreefold curse of the\r\n",
      "Childâ suggested calamities which they dreaded. Making no answer, they\r\n",

      "my mind at this juncture the dying words of the Zulu captain and seer,\r\n",

      "enthusiasm of the war-horse as described in the Book of Job; indeed I\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "But this happened a few minutes later.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As we drew near the enemy I saw that they had massed their footmen in a\r\n",
      "dense body, six or eight lines thick. There they stood to receive the\r\n",
      "impact of our charge, or rather they did not all stand, for the first\r\n",
      "two ranks were kneeling with long spears stretched out in front of\r\n",
      "them. I imagine that their appearance must have greatly resembled that\r\n",
      "of the Greek phalanx, or that of the Swiss prepared to receive cavalry\r\n",
      "in the Middle Ages. On either side of this formidable body, which by\r\n",
      "now must have numbered four or five hundred men, and at a distance\r\n",
      "perhaps of a quarter of a mile from them, were gathered the horsemen of\r\n",
      "the Black Kendah, divided into two bodies of nearly equal strength, say\r\n",
      "about a hundred horse in each body.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As we approached, our triangle curved a little, no doubt under the\r\n",
      "direction of HarÃ»t. A minute or so later I saw the reason. It was that\r\n",
      "we might strike the foot-soldiers not full in front but at an angle. It\r\n",
      "was an admirable manoeuvre, for when presently we did strike, we caught\r\n",
      "them swiftly on the flank and crumpled them up. My word! we went\r\n",
      "through those fellows like a knife through butter; they had as much\r\n",
      "chance against the rush of our camels as a brown-paper screen has\r\n",
      "against a typhoon. Over they rolled in heaps while the White Kendah\r\n",
      "spitted them with their lances.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThe Child is top dog! My money on the Child,â reflected I in\r\n",
      "irreverent ecstasy. But that exultation was premature, for those Black\r\n",
      "Kendah were by no means all dead. Presently I saw that scores of them\r\n",
      "had appeared among the camels, which they were engaged in stabbing, or\r\n",
      "trying to stab, in the stomach with their spears. Also I had forgotten\r\n",
      "the horsemen. As our charge slackened owing to the complication in\r\n",
      "front, these arrived on our flanks like two thunderbolts. We faced\r\n",
      "about and did our best to meet the onslaught, of which the net result\r\n",
      "was that both our left and right lines were pierced through about fifty\r\n",
      "yards behind the baggage camels. Luckily for us the very impetuosity of\r\n",
      "the Black Kendah rush deprived it of most of the fruits of victory,\r\n",
      "since the two squadrons, being unable to check their horses, ended by\r\n",
      "charging into each other and becoming mixed in inextricable confusion.\r\n",
      "Then, I do not know who gave the order, we wheeled our camels in and\r\n",
      "fell upon them, a struggling, stationary mass, with the result that\r\n",
      "many of them were speared, or overthrown and trampled.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I have said we, but that is not quite correct, at any rate so far as\r\n",
      "MarÃ»t, Hans, I and about fifteen camelmen were concerned. How it\r\n",
      "happened I could not tell in that dust and confusion, but we were cut\r\n",
      "off from the main body and presently found ourselves fighting\r\n",
      "desperately in a group at which Black Kendah horsemen were charging\r\n",
      "again and again. We made the best stand we could. By degrees the\r\n",
      "bewildered camels sank under the repeated spear-thrusts of the enemy,\r\n",
      "all except one, oddly enough that ridden by Hans, which by some strange\r\n",
      "chance was never touched. The rest of us were thrown or tumbled off the\r\n",
      "camels and continued the fight from behind their struggling bodies.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That is where I came in. Up to this time I had not fired a single shot,\r\n",
      "partly because I do not like missing, which it is so easy to do from\r\n",
      "the back of a swaying camel, and still more for the reason that I had\r\n",
      "not the slightest desire to kill any of these savage men unless I was\r\n",
      "obliged to do so in self-defence. Now, however, the thing was\r\n",
      "different, as I was fighting for my life. Leaning against my camel,\r\n",
      "which was dying and beating its head upon the ground, groaning horribly\r\n",
      "the while, I emptied the five cartridges of the repeater into those\r\n",
      "Black Kendah, pausing between each shot to take aim, with the result\r\n",
      "that presently five riderless horses were galloping loose about the\r\n",
      "veld.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The effect was electrical, since our attackers had never seen anything\r\n",
      "of the kind before. For a while they all drew off, which gave me time\r\n",
      "to reload. Then they came on again and I repeated the process. For a\r\n",
      "second time they retreated and after consultation which lasted for a\r\n",
      "minute or more, made a third attack. Once more I saluted them to the\r\n",
      "best of my ability, though on this occasion only three men and a horse\r\n",
      "fell. The fifth shot was a clean miss because they came on in such a\r\n",
      "scattered formation that I had to turn from side to side to fire.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now at last the game was up, for the simple reason that I had no more\r\n",
      "cartridges save two in my double-barrelled pistol. It may be asked why.\r\n",
      "The answer is, want of foresight. Too many cartridges in oneâs pocket\r\n",
      "are apt to chafe on camel-back and so is a belt full of them. In those\r\n",
      "days also the engagements were few in which a man fired over fifteen. I\r\n",
      "had forty or fifty more in a bag, which bag Savage with his usual\r\n",
      "politeness had taken and hung upon his saddle without saying a word to\r\n",
      "me. At the beginning of the action I found this out, but could not then\r\n",
      "get them from him as he was separated from me. Hans, always careless in\r\n",
      "small matters, was really to blame as he ought to have seen that I had\r\n",
      "the cartridges, or at any rate to have carried them himself. In short,\r\n",
      "it was one of those accidents that will happen. There is nothing more\r\n",
      "to be said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After a still longer consultation our enemies advanced on us for the\r\n",
      "fourth time, but very slowly. Meanwhile I had been taking stock of the\r\n",
      "position. The camel corps, or what was left of it, oblivious of our\r\n",
      "plight which the dust of conflict had hidden from them, was travelling\r\n",
      "on to the north, more or less victorious. That is to say, it had cut\r\n",
      "its way through the Black Kendah and was escaping unpursued, huddled up\r\n",
      "in a mob with the baggage animals safe in its centre. The Black Kendah\r\n",
      "themselves were engaged in killing our wounded and succouring their\r\n",
      "own; also in collecting the bodies of the dead. In short, quite\r\n",
      "unintentionally, we were deserted. Probably, if anybody thought about\r\n",
      "us at all in the turmoil of desperate battle, they concluded that we\r\n",
      "were among the slain.\r\n",

      "âLord Macumazana,â he said, âthe end is at hand. The Child has saved\r\n",
      "the others, or most of them, but us it has abandoned. Now what will you\r\n",
      "do? Kill yourself, or if that does not please you, suffer me to kill\r\n",
      "you? Or shoot on until you must surrender?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI have nothing to shoot with any more,â I answered. âBut if we\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âThen I think you are foolish, MarÃ»t, since once we are dead, we are\r\n",
      "dead; but while we are alive it is always possible that we may escape\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Then he turned and explained things to his followers, who spoke\r\n",
      "together for a moment. In the end these took a strange and, to my mind,\r\n",
      "a very heroic decision. Waiting till the attacking Kendah were quite\r\n",
      "close to us, with the exception of three men, who either because they\r\n",
      "lacked courage or for some other reason, stayed with us, they advanced\r\n",
      "humbly as though to make submission. A number of the Black Kendah\r\n",
      "dismounted and ran up, I suppose to take them prisoners. The men waited\r\n",
      "till these were all round them. Then with a yell of âThe Child!â they\r\n",
      "sprang forward, taking the enemy unawares and fighting like demons,\r\n",

      "wounds.\r\n",

      "with blows of the rifle stock, he departed at a great rate, not towards\r\n",
      "the home of the Child but up the hill into a brake of giant grass\r\n",

      "what kind of an impression I produced upon him. My hat had fallen off,\r\n",
      "or I had knocked it off when I fired my last cartridge into his people,\r\n",
      "and forgotten to replace it, and my intractable hair, which was longer\r\n",
      "than usual, had not been recently brushed. My worn Norfolk jacket was\r\n",
      "dyed with blood from a wounded or dying man who had tumbled against me\r\n",
      "in the scrimmage when the cavalry charged us, and my right leg and boot\r\n",
      "were stained in a similar fashion from having rubbed against my camel\r\n",

      "Child will take Jana and his followers. Which of these things must\r\n",
      "happen is known to the Child alone, and perchance to its prophets.\r\n",
      "Meanwhile, for every one of those of the Child I think that three of\r\n",
      "the followers of Jana, or more, lie dead upon this field. Also the\r\n",
      "caravan is now out of your reach with two of the white lords and many\r\n",
      "of such tubes which deal death, like that which we have surrendered to\r\n",
      "you. Therefore because we are helpless, do not think that the Child is\r\n",
      "helpless. Jana must have been asleep, O King, or you would have set\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "I thought that this coolly insolent speech would have produced some\r\n",
      "outburst, but in fact it seemed to have an opposite effect. Making no\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âI come to drink the cup of peace with you and the white lord, O\r\n",

      "Then a man filled the great ivory cup with water from the skin he\r\n",
      "carried. Simba took it and having sprinkled a little upon the ground, I\r\n",
      "suppose as an offering, drank from the cup, doubtless to show that it\r\n",
      "was not poisoned. Watching carefully, I made sure that he swallowed\r\n",
      "what he drank by studying the motions of his throat. Then he handed the\r\n",
      "cup with a bow to MarÃ»t, who with a still deeper bow passed it to me.\r\n",
      "Being absolutely parched I absorbed about a pint of it, and feeling a\r\n",
      "new man, passed the horn to MarÃ»t, who swallowed the rest. Then it was\r\n",
      "filled again for our three White Kendah, the King first tasting the\r\n",
      "water as before, after which MarÃ»t and I had a second pull.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When at length our thirst was satisfied, horses were brought to us,\r\n",
      "serviceable and docile little beasts with sheepskins for saddles and\r\n",
      "loops of hide for stirrups. On these we mounted and for the next three\r\n",
      "hours rode across the plain, surrounded by a strong escort and with an\r\n",
      "armed Black Kendah running on each side of our horses and holding in\r\n",
      "his hand a thong attached to the ring of the bridle, no doubt to\r\n",
      "prevent any attempt to escape.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Our road ran past but not through some villages whence we saw many\r\n",
      "women and children staring at us, and through beautiful crops of\r\n",
      "mealies and other sorts of grain that in this country were now just\r\n",
      "ripening. The luxuriant appearance of these crops suggested that the\r\n",
      "rains must have been plentiful and the season all that could be\r\n",
      "desired. From some of the villages by the track arose a miserable sound\r\n",
      "of wailing. Evidently their inhabitants had already heard that certain\r\n",
      "of their menkind had fallen in that morningâs fight.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At the end of the third hour we began to enter the great forest which I\r\n",
      "had seen when first we looked down on Kendahland. It was filled with\r\n",
      "splendid trees, most of them quite strange to me, but perhaps because\r\n",
      "of the denseness of their overshadowing crowns there was comparatively\r\n",
      "no undergrowth. The general effect of the place was very gloomy, since\r\n",
      "little light could pass through the interlacing foliage of the tops of\r\n",
      "those mighty trees.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Towards evening we came to a clearing in this forest, it may have been\r\n",
      "four or five miles in diameter, but whether it was natural or\r\n",
      "artificial I am not sure. I think, however, that it was probably the\r\n",
      "former for two reasons: the hollow nature of the ground, which lay a\r\n",
      "good many feet lower than the surrounding forest, and the wonderful\r\n",
      "fertility of the soil, which suggested that it had once been deposited\r\n",
      "upon an old lake bottom. Never did I see such crops as those that grew\r\n",
      "upon that clearing; they were magnificent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Wending our way along the road that ran through the tall corn, for here\r\n",
      "every inch was cultivated, we came suddenly upon the capital of the\r\n",
      "Black Kendah, which was known as Simba Town. It was a large place,\r\n",
      "somewhat different from any other African settlement with which I am\r\n",
      "acquainted, inasmuch as it was not only stockaded but completely\r\n",
      "surrounded by a broad artificial moat filled with water from a stream\r\n",
      "that ran through the centre of the town, over which moat there were\r\n",
      "four timber bridges placed at the cardinal points of the compass. These\r\n",
      "bridges were strong enough to bear horses or stock, but so made that in\r\n",
      "the event of attack they could be destroyed in a few minutes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Riding through the eastern gate, a stout timber structure on the\r\n",
      "farther side of the corresponding bridge, where the king was received\r\n",
      "with salutes by an armed guard, we entered one of the main streets of\r\n",
      "the town which ran from north to south and from east to west. It was\r\n",
      "broad and on either side of it were the dwellings of the inhabitants\r\n",
      "set close together because the space within the stockade was limited.\r\n",
      "These were not huts but square buildings of mud with flat roofs of some\r\n",
      "kind of cement. Evidently they were built upon the model of Oriental\r\n",
      "and North African houses of which some debased tradition remained with\r\n",
      "these people. Thus a stairway or ladder ran from the interior to the\r\n",
      "roof of each house, whereon its inhabitants were accustomed, as I\r\n",
      "discovered afterwards, to sleep during a good part of the year, also to\r\n",
      "eat in the cool of the day. Many of them were gathered there now to\r\n",
      "watch us pass, men, women, and children, all except the little ones\r\n",
      "decently clothed in long garments of various colours, the women for the\r\n",
      "most part in white and the men in a kind of bluish linen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I saw at once that they had already heard of the fight and of the\r\n",
      "considerable losses which their people had sustained, for their\r\n",
      "reception of us prisoners was most unfriendly. Indeed the men shook\r\n",
      "their fists at us, the women screamed out curses, while the children\r\n",
      "stuck out their tongues in token of derision or defiance. Most of these\r\n",
      "demonstrations, however, were directed at MarÃ»t and his followers, who\r\n",
      "only smiled indifferently. At me they stared in wonder not unmixed with\r\n",
      "fear.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A quarter of a mile or so from the gate we came to an inner enclosure,\r\n",
      "that answered to the South African cattle kraal, surrounded by a dry\r\n",
      "ditch and a timber palisade outside of which was planted a green fence\r\n",
      "of some shrub with long white thorns. Here we passed through more\r\n",
      "gates, to find ourselves in an oval space, perhaps five acres in\r\n",
      "extent. Evidently this served as a market ground, but all around it\r\n",
      "were open sheds where hundreds of horses were stabled. No cattle seemed\r\n",
      "to be kept there, except a few that with sheep and goats were driven in\r\n",
      "every day for slaughter purposes at a shambles at the north end, from\r\n",
      "the great stock kraals built beyond the forest to the south, where they\r\n",
      "were safe from possible raiding by the White Kendah.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A tall reed fence cut off the southern end of this marketplace, outside\r\n",
      "of which we were ordered to dismount. Passing through yet another gate\r\n",
      "we found within the fence a large hut or house built on the same model\r\n",
      "as the others in the town, which MarÃ»t whispered to me was that of the\r\n",
      "king. Behind it were smaller houses in which lived his queen and women,\r\n",
      "good-looking females, who advanced to meet him with obsequious bows. To\r\n",
      "the right and left were two more buildings of about equal size, one of\r\n",
      "which was occupied by the royal guard and the other was the guest-house\r\n",
      "whither we were conducted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It proved to be a comfortable dwelling about thirty feet square but\r\n",
      "containing only one room, with various huts behind it that served for\r\n",
      "cooking and other purposes. In one of these the three camelmen were\r\n",
      "placed. Immediately on our arrival food was brought to us, a lamb or\r\n",
      "kid roasted whole upon a wooden platter, and some green mealie-cobs\r\n",
      "boiled upon another platter; also water to drink and wash with in\r\n",
      "earthenware jars of sun-dried clay.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I ate heartily, for I was starving. Then, as it was useless to attempt\r\n",
      "precautions against murder, without any talk to my fellow prisoner, for\r\n",
      "which we were both too tired, I threw myself down on a mattress stuffed\r\n",
      "with corn husks in a corner of the hut, drew a skin rug over me and,\r\n",

      "The next thing I remember was feeling upon my face the sunlight that\r\n",
      "poured through a window-place which was protected by immovable wooden\r\n",
      "bars. For a while I lay still, reflecting as memory returned to me upon\r\n",
      "all the events of the previous day and upon my present unhappy\r\n",
      "position. Here I was a prisoner in the hands of a horde of fierce\r\n",
      "savages who had every reason to hate me, for though this was done in\r\n",
      "self-defence, had I not killed a number of their people against whom\r\n",
      "personally I had no quarrel? It was true that their king had promised\r\n",
      "me safety, but what reliance could be put upon the word of such a man?\r\n",
      "Unless something occurred to save me, without doubt my days were\r\n",

      "right for ever entering upon such a business.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The only satisfactory point in the story was that, for the present at\r\n",
      "any rate, Ragnall and Savage had escaped, though doubtless sooner or\r\n",
      "later fate would overtake them also. I was sure that they had escaped,\r\n",
      "since two of the camelmen with us had informed MarÃ»t that they saw them\r\n",
      "swept away surrounded by our people and quite unharmed. Now they would\r\n",
      "be grieving over my death, since none survived who could tell them of\r\n",
      "our capture, unless the Black Kendah chose to do so, which was not\r\n",
      "likely. I wondered what course they would take when Ragnall found that\r\n",

      "through, as he never forgot a path which he had once travelled, though\r\n",

      "assistant priests was standing in front of the mouth of that barrel,\r\n",
      "and he also hopped once, but never again, for the heavy bullet struck\r\n",
      "him somewhere in the body and killed him. Now there was consternation.\r\n",
      "Everyone ran away, leaving the dead man lying on the ground. Simba led\r\n",

      "Having observed these events, which filled me with an unholy joy, we\r\n",

      "discomfiture, might irritate these savages. About ten minutes later the\r\n",
      "gate of the fence round the guest-house was thrown open, and through it\r\n",
      "came four men carrying on a stretcher the body of the priest whom the\r\n",
      "bullet had killed, which they laid down in front of our door. Then\r\n",
      "followed the king with an armed guard, and after him the befeathered\r\n",
      "diviner with his foot bound up, who supported himself upon the\r\n",
      "shoulders of two of his colleagues. This man, I now perceived, wore a\r\n",
      "hideous mask, from which projected two tusks in imitation of those of\r\n",
      "an elephant. Also there were others, as many as the space would hold.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The king called to us to come out of the house, which, having no\r\n",
      "choice, we did. One glance at him showed me that the man was frantic\r\n",
      "with fear, or rage, or both.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âLook upon your work, magicians!â he said in a terrible voice, pointing\r\n",

      "with you. But you have broken the pact, working us more harm, and\r\n",
      "therefore it no longer holds, since there are many other ways in which\r\n",
      "men can die. Listen again! This is my decree. By your magic you have\r\n",
      "taken away the life of one of my servants and hurt another of my\r\n",
      "servants, destroying the middle toe of his left foot. If within three\r\n",
      "days you do not give back the life to him who seems to be dead, and\r\n",
      "give back the toe to him who seems to be hurt, as you well can do, then\r\n",

      "will not tell you.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now when I heard this amazing sentence I gasped within myself, but\r\n",
      "thinking it better to keep up my rÃ´le of understanding nothing of their\r\n",
      "talk, I preserved an immovable countenance and left MarÃ»t to answer.\r\n",
      "This, to his credit be it recorded, he did with his customary pleasant\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âWhat did my brother, the great Prophet, promise to you but yesterday,\r\n",
      "O King, if you harmed us?â asked MarÃ»t. âWas it not that the three\r\n",

      "worshippers, who, he declared, had worked evil on the Black Kendah for\r\n",
      "generations. He appealed to his god Jana to avenge these evils, âto\r\n",
      "pierce the Child with his tusks, to tear it with his trunk, and to\r\n",
      "trample it with his feet,â all of which the wounded diviner ably\r\n",
      "seconded through his horrid mask.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There we stood before him, I leaning against the wall of the house with\r\n",
      "an air of studied nonchalance mingled with mild interest, at least that\r\n",
      "is what I meant to do, and MarÃ»t smiling sweetly and staring at the\r\n",
      "heavens. Whilst I was wondering what exact portion of my frame was\r\n",
      "destined to become acquainted with that spear, of a sudden Simba gave\r\n",
      "it up. Turning to his followers, he bade them dig a hole in the corner\r\n",
      "of our little enclosure and set the dead man in it, âwith his head out\r\n",
      "so that he may breathe,â an order which they promptly executed.\r\n",

      "morning from that day, we should hear from him again, he and his\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Soon this was finished also. There sat the deceased buried to the neck\r\n",

      "Presently, however, matters were improved in this respect by one of the\r\n",
      "sextons fetching a large earthenware pot and several smaller pots full\r\n",
      "of food and water. The latter they set round the head, I suppose for\r\n",
      "the sustenance of the body beneath, and then placed the big vessel\r\n",
      "inverted over all, âto keep the sun off our sleeping brother,â as I\r\n",
      "heard one say to the other.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "such is the strength of the imagination, I think that on the whole I\r\n",
      "should have preferred the object underneath naked and unadorned. For\r\n",
      "instance, I have forgotten to say that the heads of those of the White\r\n",
      "Kendah who had fallen in the fight had been set up on poles in front of\r\n",
      "Simbaâs house. They were unpleasant to contemplate, but to my mind not\r\n",
      "so unpleasant as that pot.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As a matter of fact, this precaution against injury from the sun to the\r\n",
      "late diviner proved unnecessary, since by some strange chance from that\r\n",
      "moment the sun ceased to shine. Quite suddenly clouds arose which\r\n",
      "gradually covered the whole sky and the weather began to turn very\r\n",
      "cold, unprecedentedly so, MarÃ»t informed me, for the time of year,\r\n",
      "which, it will be remembered, in this country was the season just\r\n",
      "before harvest. Obviously the Black Kendah thought so also, since from\r\n",
      "our seats on the roof, whither we had retreated to be as far as\r\n",
      "possible from the pot, we saw them gathered in the market-place,\r\n",
      "staring at the sky and talking to each other.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The day passed without any further event, except the arrival of our\r\n",
      "meals, for which we had no great appetite. The night came, earlier than\r\n",
      "usual because of the clouds, and we fell asleep, or rather into a\r\n",
      "series of dozes. Once I thought that I heard someone stirring in the\r\n",
      "huts behind us, but as it was followed by silence I took no more\r\n",
      "notice. At length the light broke very slowly, for now the clouds were\r\n",
      "denser than ever. Shivering with the cold, MarÃ»t and I made a visit to\r\n",
      "the camel-drivers, who were not allowed to enter our house. On going\r\n",
      "into their hut we saw to our horror that only two of them remained,\r\n",
      "seated stonily upon the floor. We asked where the third was. They\r\n",
      "replied they did not know. In the middle of the night, they said, men\r\n",
      "had crept in, who seized, bound and gagged him, then dragged him away.\r\n",
      "As there was nothing to be said or done, we returned to breakfast\r\n",
      "filled with horrid fears.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nothing happened that day except that some priests arrived, lifted the\r\n",
      "earthenware pot, examined their departed colleague, who by now had\r\n",
      "become an unencouraging spectacle, removed old dishes of food, arranged\r\n",
      "more about him, and went off. Also the clouds grew thicker and thicker,\r\n",
      "and the air more and more chilly, till, had we been in any northern\r\n",
      "latitude, I should have said that snow was pending. From our perch on\r\n",
      "the roof-top I observed the population of Simba Town discussing the\r\n",
      "weather with ever-increasing eagerness; also that the people who were\r\n",
      "going out to work in the fields wore mats over their shoulders.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Once more darkness came, and this night, notwithstanding the cold, we\r\n",
      "spent wrapped in rugs, on the roof of the house. It had occurred to us\r\n",
      "that kidnapping would be less easy there, as we could make some sort of\r\n",
      "a fight at the head of the stairway, or, if the worst came to the\r\n",
      "worst, dive from the parapet and break our necks. We kept watch turn\r\n",
      "and turn about. During my watch about midnight I heard a noise going on\r\n",
      "in the hut behind us; scuffling and a stifled cry which turned my blood\r\n",
      "cold. About an hour later a fire was lighted in the centre of the\r\n",
      "market-place where the sheep had been sacrificed, and by the flare of\r\n",
      "it I could see people moving. But what they did I could not see, which\r\n",
      "was perhaps as well.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Next morning only one of the camelmen was left. This remaining man was\r\n",
      "now almost crazy with fear, and could give no clear account of what had\r\n",
      "happened to his companion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The poor fellow implored us to take him away to our house, as he feared\r\n",
      "to be left alone with âthe black devils.â We tried to do so, but armed\r\n",
      "guards appeared mysteriously and thrust him back into his own hut.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This day was an exact repetition of the others. The same inspection of\r\n",
      "the deceased and renewal of his food; the same cold, clouded sky, the\r\n",
      "same agitated conferences in the market-place.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For the third time darkness fell upon us in that horrible place. Once\r\n",
      "more we took refuge on the roof, but this night neither of us slept. We\r\n",
      "were too cold, too physically miserable, and too filled with mental\r\n",
      "apprehensions. All nature seemed to be big with impending disaster. The\r\n",
      "sky appeared to be sinking down upon the earth. The moon was hidden,\r\n",
      "yet a faint and lurid light shone now in one quarter of the horizon,\r\n",
      "now in another. There was no wind, but the air moaned audibly. It was\r\n",
      "as though the end of the world were near as, I reflected, probably\r\n",
      "might be the case so far as we were concerned. Never, perhaps, have I\r\n",
      "felt so spiritually terrified as I was during the dreadful inaction of\r\n",
      "that night. Even if I had known that I was going to be executed at\r\n",
      "dawn, I think that by comparison I should have been light-hearted. But\r\n",
      "the worst part of the business was that I knew nothing. I was like a\r\n",
      "man forced to walk through dense darkness among precipices, quite\r\n",
      "unable to guess when my journey would end in space, but enduring all\r\n",
      "the agonies of death at every step.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "About midnight again we heard that scuffle and stifled cry in the hut\r\n",
      "behind us.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âHeâs gone,â I whispered to MarÃ»t, wiping the cold sweat from my brow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYes,â answered MarÃ»t, âand very soon we shall follow him, Macumazana.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I wished that his face were visible so that I could see if he still\r\n",
      "smiled when he uttered those words.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "An hour or so later the usual fire appeared in the marketplace, round\r\n",
      "which the usual figures flitted dimly. The sight of them fascinated me,\r\n",
      "although I did not want to look, fearing what I might see. Luckily,\r\n",
      "however, we were too far off to discern anything at night.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While these unholy ceremonies were in progress the climax came, that is\r\n",
      "so far as the weather was concerned. Of a sudden a great gale sprang\r\n",
      "up, a gale of icy wind such as in Southern Africa sometimes precedes a\r\n",
      "thunderstorm. It blew for half an hour or more, then lulled. Now\r\n",
      "lightning flashed across the heavens, and by the glare of it we\r\n",
      "perceived that all the population of Simba Town seemed to be gathered\r\n",
      "in the market-place. At least there were some thousands of them,\r\n",
      "talking, gesticulating, pointing at the sky.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A few minutes later there came a great crash of thunder, of which it\r\n",
      "was impossible to locate the sound, for it rolled from everywhere. Then\r\n",
      "suddenly something hard struck the roof by my side and rebounded, to be\r\n",
      "followed next moment by a blow upon my shoulder which nearly knocked me\r\n",
      "flat, although I was well protected by the skin rugs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âDown the stair!â I called. âThey are stoning us,â and suited the\r\n",
      "action to the word.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ten seconds later we were both in the room, crouched in its farther\r\n",
      "corner, for the stones or whatever they were seemed to be following us.\r\n",
      "I struck a match, of which fortunately I had some, together with my\r\n",
      "pipe and a good pocketful of tobaccoâmy only solace in those daysâand,\r\n",
      "as it burned up, saw first that blood was running down MarÃ»tâs face,\r\n",
      "and secondly, that these stones were great lumps of ice, some of them\r\n",
      "weighing several ounces, which hopped about the floor like live things.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âHailstorm!â remarked MarÃ»t with his accustomed smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âHell storm!â I replied, âfor whoever saw hail like that before?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then the match burnt out and conversation came to an end for the reason\r\n",
      "that we could no longer hear each other speak. The hail came down with\r\n",
      "a perpetual, rattling roar, that in its sum was one of the most\r\n",
      "terrible sounds to which I ever listened. And yet above it I thought\r\n",
      "that I could catch another, still more terrible, the wail of hundreds\r\n",
      "of people in agony. After the first few minutes I began to be afraid\r\n",
      "that the roof would be battered in, or that the walls would crumble\r\n",
      "beneath this perpetual fire of the musketry of heaven. But the cement\r\n",
      "was good and the place well built.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So it came about that the house stood the tempest, which had it been\r\n",
      "roofed with tiles or galvanized iron I am sure it would never have\r\n",
      "done, since the lumps of ice must have shattered one and pierced the\r\n",
      "other like paper. Indeed I have seen this happen in a bad hailstorm in\r\n",
      "Natal which killed my best horse. But even that hail was as snowflakes\r\n",
      "compared to this.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I suppose that this natural phenomenon continued for about twenty\r\n",
      "minutes, not more, during ten of which it was at its worst. Then by\r\n",
      "degrees it ceased, the sky cleared and the moon shone out beautifully.\r\n",
      "We climbed to the roof again and looked. It was several inches deep in\r\n",
      "jagged ice, while the market-place and all the country round appeared\r\n",
      "in the bright moonlight to be buried beneath a veil of snow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Very rapidly, as the normal temperature of that warm land reasserted\r\n",
      "itself, this snow or rather hail melted, causing a flood of water\r\n",
      "which, where there was any fall, began to rush away with a gurgling\r\n",
      "sound. Also we heard other sounds, such as that from the galloping\r\n",
      "hoofs of many of the horses which had broken loose from their wrecked\r\n",
      "stables at the north end of the market-place, where in great number\r\n",
      "they had been killed by the falling roofs or had kicked each other to\r\n",
      "death, and a wild universal wail that rose from every quarter of the\r\n",
      "big town, in which quantities of the worst-built houses had collapsed.\r\n",
      "Further, lying here and there about the market-place we could see\r\n",
      "scores of dark shapes that we knew to be those of men, women and\r\n",
      "children, whom those sharp missiles hurled from heaven had caught\r\n",
      "before they could escape and slain or wounded almost to death. For it\r\n",
      "will be remembered that perhaps not fewer than two thousand people were\r\n",
      "gathered on this market-place, attending the horrid midnight sacrifice\r\n",
      "and discussing the unnatural weather when the storm burst upon them\r\n",
      "suddenly as an avalanche.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThe Child is small, yet its strength is great. Behold the first\r\n",
      "curse!â said MarÃ»t solemnly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I stared at him, but as he chose to believe that a very unusual\r\n",
      "hailstorm was a visitation from heaven I did not think it worth while\r\n",
      "arguing the point. Only I wondered if he really did believe this. Then\r\n",
      "I remembered that such an event was said to have afflicted the old\r\n",
      "Egyptians in the hour of their pride because they would not âlet the\r\n",
      "people go.â Well, these blackguardedly Black Kendah were certainly\r\n",
      "worse than the Egyptians can ever have been; also they would not let\r\n",
      "_us_ go. It was not wonderful therefore that MarÃ»t should be the victim\r\n",
      "of phantasies on the matter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Not until the following morning did we come to understand the full\r\n",
      "extent of the calamity which had overtaken the Black Kendah. I think I\r\n",
      "have said that their crops this year were magnificent and just ripening\r\n",
      "to harvest. From our roof on previous days we could see a great area of\r\n",
      "them stretching to the edge of the forest. When the sun rose that\r\n",
      "morning this area had vanished, and the ground was covered with a\r\n",
      "carpet of green pulp. Also the forest itself appeared suddenly to have\r\n",
      "experienced the full effects of a northern winter. Not a leaf was left\r\n",
      "upon the trees, which stood there pointing their naked boughs to\r\n",
      "heaven.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "No one who had not seen it could imagine the devastating fury of that\r\n",
      "storm. For example, the head of the diviner who was buried in the\r\n",
      "court-yard awaiting resurrection through our magic was, it may be\r\n",
      "recalled, covered with a stout earthenware pot. Now that pot had\r\n",
      "shattered into sherds and the head beneath was nothing but bits of\r\n",
      "broken bone which it would have been impossible for the very best magic\r\n",
      "to reconstruct to the likeness of a human being.\r\n",

      "No breakfast was brought to us that morning, probably for the reason\r\n",
      "that there was none to bring. This did not matter, however, seeing that\r\n",
      "plenty of food accumulated from supper and other meals stood in a\r\n",
      "corner of the house practically untouched. So we ate what we could and\r\n",
      "then paid our usual visit to the hut in which the camelmen had been\r\n",
      "confined. I say had been, for now it was quite empty, the last poor\r\n",
      "fellow having vanished away like his companions.\r\n",

      "The sight of this vacuum filled me with a kind of fury.\r\n",

      "âThey have all been murdered!â I said to MarÃ»t.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNo,â he replied with gentle accuracy. âThey have been sacrificed to\r\n",
      "Jana. What we have seen on the market-place at night was the rite of\r\n",
      "their sacrifice. Now it will be our turn, Lord Macumazana.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWell,â I exclaimed, âI hope these devils are satisfied with Janaâs\r\n",

      "pranks on usâââ\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âDoubtless there will be another answer. But, Lord, the question is,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Dumb with impotent rage I returned to the house, where presently the\r\n",
      "remains of the reed gate opened. Through it appeared Simba the King,\r\n",
      "the diviner with the injured foot walking upon crutches, and others of\r\n",
      "whom the most were more or less wounded, presumably by the hailstones.\r\n",
      "Then it was that in my wrath I put off the pretence of not\r\n",
      "understanding their language and went for them before they could utter\r\n",
      "a single word.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhere are our servants, you murderers?â I asked, shaking my fist at\r\n",
      "them. âHave you sacrificed them to your devil-god? If so, behold the\r\n",
      "fruits of sacrifice!â and I swept my arm towards the country beyond.\r\n",
      "âWhere are your crops?â I went on. âTell me on what you will live this\r\n",
      "winter?â (At these words they quailed. In their imagination already\r\n",
      "they saw famine stalking towards them.) âWhy do you keep us here? Is it\r\n",
      "that you wait for a worse thing to befall you? Why do you visit us here\r\n",
      "now?â and I paused, gasping with indignation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWe came to look whether you had brought back to life that doctor whom\r\n",
      "you killed with your magic, white man,â answered the king heavily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I stepped to the corner of the court-yard and, drawing aside a mat that\r\n",
      "I had thrown there, showed them what lay beneath.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âLook then,â I said, âand be sure that if you do not let us go, as\r\n",
      "yonder thing is, so shall all of you be before another moon has been\r\n",
      "born and died. Such is the life we shall give to evil men like you.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now they grew positively terrified.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âLord,â said Simba, for the first time addressing me by a title of\r\n",
      "respect, âyour magic is too strong for us. Great misfortune has fallen\r\n",
      "upon our land. Hundreds of people are dead, killed by the ice-stones\r\n",
      "that you have called down. Our harvest is ruined, and there is but\r\n",
      "little corn left in the storepits now when we looked to gather the new\r\n",
      "grain. Messengers come in from the outlying land telling us that nearly\r\n",
      "all the sheep and goats and very many of the cattle are slain. Soon we\r\n",
      "shall starve.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Simba stared at me doubtfully, then began to whisper into the ear of\r\n",
      "the lamed diviner. I could not catch what they said, so I watched their\r\n",
      "faces. That of the diviner whose head I was glad to see had been cut by\r\n",
      "a hailstone so that both ends of him were now injured, told me a good\r\n",
      "deal. His mask had been ugly, but now that it was off the countenance\r\n",
      "beneath was far uglier. Of a negroid type, pendulous-lipped, sensuous\r\n",
      "and loose-eyed, he was indeed a hideous fellow, yet very cunning and\r\n",
      "cruel-looking, as men of his class are apt to be. Humbled as he was for\r\n",
      "the moment, I felt sure that he was still plotting evil against us,\r\n",
      "somewhat against the will of his master. The issue showed that I was\r\n",
      "right. At length Simba spoke, saying:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWe had intended, Lord, to keep you and the priest of the Child here as\r\n",
      "hostages against mischief that might be worked on us by the followers\r\n",
      "of the Child, who have always been our bitter enemies and done us much\r\n",
      "undeserved wrong, although on our part we have faithfully kept the pact\r\n",
      "concluded in the days of our grandfathers. It seems, however, that\r\n",
      "fate, or your magic, is too strong for us, and therefore I have\r\n",
      "determined to let you go. To-night at sundown we will set you on the\r\n",
      "road which leads to the ford of the River Tava, which divides our\r\n",
      "territory from that of the White Kendah, and you may depart where you\r\n",
      "will, since our wish is that never again may we see your ill-omened\r\n",
      "faces.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this intelligence my heart leapt in joy that was altogether\r\n",
      "premature. But, preserving my indignant air, I exclaimed:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âTo-night! Why to-night? Why not at once? It is hard for us to cross\r\n",
      "unknown rivers in the dark.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThe water is low, Lord, and the ford easy. Moreover, if you started\r\n",
      "now you would reach it in the dark; whereas if you start at sundown,\r\n",
      "you will reach it in the morning. Lastly, we cannot conduct you hence\r\n",
      "until we have buried our dead.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then, without giving me time to answer, he turned and left the place,\r\n",
      "followed by the others. Only at the gateway the diviner wheeled round\r\n",
      "on his crutches and glared at us both, muttering something with his\r\n",
      "thick lips; probably it was curses.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAt any rate they are going to set us free,â I said to MarÃ»t, not\r\n",
      "without exultation, when they had all vanished.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYes, Lord,â he replied, âbut _where_ are they going to set us free?\r\n",
      "The demon Jana lives in the forests and the swamps by the banks of the\r\n",
      "Tava River, and it is said that he ravages at night.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I did not pursue the subject, but reflected to myself cheerfully that\r\n",
      "this mystic rogue-elephant was a long way off and might be\r\n",
      "circumvented, whereas that altar of sacrifice was extremely near and\r\n",
      "very difficult to avoid.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Never did a thief with a rich booty in view, or a wooer having an\r\n",
      "assignation with his lady, wait for sundown more eagerly than I did\r\n",
      "that day. Hour after hour I sat upon the house-top, watching the Black\r\n",
      "Kendah carrying off the dead killed by the hailstones and generally\r\n",
      "trying to repair the damage done by the terrific tempest. Watching the\r\n",
      "sun also as it climbed down the cloudless sky, and literally counting\r\n",
      "the minutes till it should reach the horizon, although I knew well that\r\n",
      "it would have been wiser after such a night to prepare for our journey\r\n",
      "by lying down to sleep.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At length the great orb began to sink in majesty behind the tattered\r\n",
      "western forest, and, punctual to the minute, Simba, with a mounted\r\n",
      "escort of some twenty men and two led horses, appeared at our gate. As\r\n",
      "our preparations, which consisted only of MarÃ»t stuffing such food as\r\n",
      "was available into the breast of his robe, were already made, we walked\r\n",
      "out of that accursed guest-house and, at a sign from the king, mounted\r\n",
      "the horses. Riding across the empty market-place and past the spot\r\n",
      "where the rough stone altar still stood with charred bones protruding\r\n",
      "from the ashes of its extinguished fireâwere they those of our friends\r\n",
      "the camel-drivers? I wonderedâwe entered the north street of the town.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Here, standing at the doors of their houses, were many of the\r\n",
      "inhabitants who had gathered to watch us pass. Never did I see hate\r\n",
      "more savage than was written on those faces as they shook their fists\r\n",
      "at us and muttered curses not loud but deep.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "No wonder! for they were all ruined, poor folk, with nothing to look\r\n",
      "forward to but starvation until long months hence the harvest came\r\n",
      "again for those who would live to gather it. Also they were convinced\r\n",
      "that we, the white magician and the prophet of their enemy the Child,\r\n",
      "had brought this disaster on them. Had it not been for the escort I\r\n",
      "believe they would have fallen on us and torn us to pieces. Considering\r\n",
      "them I understood for the first time how disagreeable real unpopularity\r\n",
      "_can be_. But when I saw the actual condition of the fruitful gardens\r\n",
      "without in the waning daylight, I confess that I was moved to some\r\n",
      "sympathy with their owners. It was appalling. Not a handful of grain\r\n",
      "was there left to gather, for the corn had been not only âlaidâ but\r\n",
      "literally cut to ribbons by the hail.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After running for some miles through the cultivated land the road\r\n",
      "entered the forest. Here it was dark as pitch, so dark that I wondered\r\n",
      "how our guides found their way. In that blackness dreadful\r\n",
      "apprehensions seized me, for I became convinced that we had been\r\n",
      "brought here to be murdered. Every minute I expected to feel a\r\n",
      "knife-thrust in my back. I thought of digging my heels into the horseâs\r\n",
      "sides and trying to gallop off anywhere, but abandoned the idea, first\r\n",
      "because I could not desert MarÃ»t, of whom I had lost touch in the\r\n",
      "gloom, and secondly because I was hemmed in by the escort. For the same\r\n",
      "reason I did not try to slip from the horse and glide away into the\r\n",
      "forest. There was nothing to be done save to go on and await the end.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It came at last some hours later. We were out of the forest now, and\r\n",
      "there was the moon rising, past her full but still very bright. Her\r\n",
      "light showed me that we were on a wild moorland, swampy, with scattered\r\n",
      "trees growing here and there, across which what seemed to be a game\r\n",
      "track ran down hill. That was all I could make out. Here the escort\r\n",
      "halted, and Simba the King said in a sullen voice:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âDismount and go your ways, evil spirits, for we travel no farther\r\n",
      "across this place which is haunted. Follow the track and it will lead\r\n",
      "you to a lake. Pass the lake and by morning you will come to the river\r\n",
      "beyond which lies the country of your friends. May its waters swallow\r\n",
      "you if you reach them. For learn, there is one who watches on this road\r\n",
      "whom few care to meet.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As he finished speaking men sprang at us and, pulling us from the\r\n",
      "horses, thrust us out of their company. Then they turned and in another\r\n",
      "minute were lost in the darkness, leaving us alone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhat now, friend MarÃ»t?â I asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNow, Lord, all we can do is to go forward, for if we stay here Simba\r\n",
      "and his people will return and kill us at the daylight. One of them\r\n",
      "said so to me.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThen, âcome on, Macduff,ââ I exclaimed, stepping out briskly, and\r\n",
      "though he had never read Shakespeare, MarÃ»t understood and followed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhat did Simba mean about âone on the road whom few care to meetâ?â I\r\n",
      "asked over my shoulder when we had done half a mile or so.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI think he meant the elephant Jana,â replied MarÃ»t with a groan.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThen I hope Jana isnât at home. Cheer up, MarÃ»t. The chances are that\r\n",
      "we shall never meet a single elephant in this big place.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYet many elephants have been here, Lord,â and he pointed to the\r\n",
      "ground. âIt is said that they come to die by the waters of the lake and\r\n",
      "this is one of the roads they follow on their death journey, a road\r\n",
      "that no other living thing dare travel.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âOh!â I exclaimed. âThen after all that was a true dream I had in the\r\n",
      "house in England.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYes, Lord, because my brother HarÃ»t once lost his way out hunting when\r\n",
      "he was young and saw what his mind showed you in the dream, and what we\r\n",
      "shall see presently, if we live to come so far.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I made no reply, both because what he said was either true or false,\r\n",
      "which I should ascertain presently, and because I was engaged in\r\n",
      "searching the ground with my eyes. He was right; many elephants had\r\n",
      "travelled this pathâone quite recently. I, a hunter of those brutes,\r\n",
      "could not be deceived on this point. Once or twice also I thought that\r\n",
      "I caught sight of the outline of some tall creature moving silently\r\n",
      "through the scattered thorns a couple of hundred yards or so to our\r\n",
      "right. It might have been an elephant or a giraffe, or perhaps nothing\r\n",
      "but a shadow, so I said nothing. As I heard no noise I was inclined to\r\n",
      "believe the latter explanation. In any case, what was the good of\r\n",
      "speaking? Unarmed and solitary amidst unknown dangers, our position was\r\n",
      "desperate, and as MarÃ»tâs nerve was already giving out, to emphasize\r\n",
      "its horrors to him would be mere foolishness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On we trudged for another two hours, during which time the only living\r\n",
      "thing that I saw was a large owl which sailed round our heads as though\r\n",
      "to look at us, and then flew away ahead.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This owl, MarÃ»t informed me, was one of âJanaâs spiesâ that kept him\r\n",
      "advised of all that was passing in his territory. I muttered âBoshâ and\r\n",
      "tramped on. Still I was glad that we saw no more of the owl, for in\r\n",
      "certain circumstances such dark fears are catching.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We reached the top of a rise, and there beneath us lay the most\r\n",
      "desolate scene that ever I have seen. At least it would have been the\r\n",
      "most desolate if I did not chance to have looked on it before, in the\r\n",
      "drawing-room of Ragnall Castle! There was no doubt about it. Below was\r\n",
      "the black, melancholy lake, a large sheet of water surrounded by reeds.\r\n",
      "Around, but at a considerable distance, appeared the tropical forest.\r\n",
      "To the east of the lake stretched a stony plain. At the time I could\r\n",
      "make out no more because of the uncertain light and the distance, for\r\n",
      "we had still over a mile to go before we reached the edge of the lake.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The aspect of the place filled me with tremblings, both because of its\r\n",
      "utter uncanniness and because of the inexplicable truth that I had seen\r\n",
      "it before. Most people will have experienced this kind of moral shock\r\n",
      "when on going to some new land they recognize a locality as being quite\r\n",
      "familiar to them in all its details. Or it may be the rooms of a house\r\n",
      "hitherto unvisited by them. Or it may be a conversation of which, when\r\n",
      "it begins, they already foreknow the sequence and the end, because in\r\n",
      "some dim state, when or how who can say, they have taken part in that\r\n",
      "talk with those same speakers. If this be so even in cheerful\r\n",
      "surroundings and among our friends or acquaintances, it is easy to\r\n",
      "imagine how much greater was the shock to me, a traveller on such a\r\n",
      "journey and in such a night.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I shrank from approaching the shores of this lake, remembering that as\r\n",
      "yet all the vision was not unrolled. I looked about me. If we went to\r\n",
      "the left we should either strike the water, or if we followed its edge,\r\n",
      "still bearing to the left, must ultimately reach the forest, where\r\n",
      "probably we should be lost. I looked to the right. The ground was\r\n",
      "strewn with boulders, among which grew thorns and rank grass,\r\n",
      "impracticable for men on foot at night. I looked behind me, meditating\r\n",
      "retreat, and there, some hundreds of yards away behind low, scrubby\r\n",
      "mimosas mixed with aloe-like plants, I saw something brown toss up and\r\n",
      "disappear again that might very well have been the trunk of an\r\n",
      "elephant. Then, animated by the courage of despair and a desire to know\r\n",
      "the worst, I began to descend the elephant track towards the lake\r\n",
      "almost at a run.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ten minutes or so more brought us to the eastern head of the lake,\r\n",
      "where the reeds whispered in the breath of the night wind like things\r\n",
      "alive. As I expected, it proved to be a bare, open space where nothing\r\n",
      "seemed to grow. Yes, and all about me were the decaying remains of\r\n",
      "elephants, hundreds of them, some with their bones covered in moss,\r\n",
      "that may have lain here for generations, and others more newly dead.\r\n",
      "They were all old beasts as I could tell by the tusks, whether male or\r\n",
      "female. Indeed about me within a radius of a quarter of a mile lay\r\n",
      "enough ivory to make a man very rich for life, since although\r\n",
      "discoloured, much of it seemed to have kept quite sound, like human\r\n",
      "teeth in a mummy case. The sight gave me a new zest for life. If only I\r\n",
      "could manage to survive and carry off that ivory! I would. In this way\r\n",
      "or in that I swore that I would! Who could possibly die with so much\r\n",
      "ivory to be had for the taking? Not that old hunter, Allan Quatermain.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then I forgot about the ivory, for there in front of me, just where it\r\n",
      "should be, just as I had seen it in the dream-picture, was the bull\r\n",
      "elephant dying, a thin and ancient brute that had lived its long life\r\n",
      "to the last hour. It searched about as though to find a convenient\r\n",
      "resting-place, and when this was discovered, stood over it, swaying to\r\n",
      "and fro for a full minute. Then it lifted its trunk and trumpeted\r\n",
      "shrilly thrice, singing its swan-song, after which it sank slowly to\r\n",
      "its knees, its trunk outstretched and the points of its worn tusks\r\n",
      "resting on the ground. Evidently it was dead.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I let my eyes travel on, and behold! about fifty yards beyond the dead\r\n",
      "bull was a mound of hard rock. I watched it with gasping expectation\r\n",
      "andâyes, on the top of the mound something slowly materialized.\r\n",
      "Although I knew what it must be well enough, for a while I could not\r\n",
      "see quite clearly because there were certain little clouds about and\r\n",
      "one of them had floated over the face of the moon. It passed, and\r\n",
      "before me, perhaps a hundred and forty paces away, outlined clearly\r\n",
      "against the sky, I perceived the devilish elephant of my vision.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oh! what a brute was that! In bulk and height it appeared to be half as\r\n",
      "big again as any of its tribe which I had known in all my lifeâs\r\n",
      "experience. It was enormous, unearthly; a survivor perhaps of some\r\n",
      "ancient species that lived before the Flood, or at least a very giant\r\n",
      "of its kind. Its grey-black sides were scarred as though with fighting.\r\n",
      "One of its huge tusks, much worn at the end, for evidently it was very\r\n",
      "old, gleamed white in the moonlight. The other was broken off about\r\n",
      "halfway down its length. When perfect it had been malformed, for it\r\n",
      "curved downwards and not upwards, also rather out to the right.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There stood this mammoth, this leviathan, this _monstrum horrendum,\r\n",
      "informe, ingens_, as I remember my old father used to call a certain\r\n",
      "gigantic and misshapen bull that we had on the Station, flapping a pair\r\n",
      "of ears that looked like the sides of a Kafir hut, and waving a trunk\r\n",
      "as big as a weaverâs beamâwhatever a weaverâs beam may beâan appalling\r\n",
      "and a petrifying sight.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I squatted behind the skeleton of an elephant which happened to be\r\n",
      "handy and well covered with moss and ferns and watched the beast,\r\n",
      "fascinated, wishing that I had a large-bore rifle in my hand. What\r\n",
      "became of MarÃ»t I do not exactly know, but I think that he lay down on\r\n",
      "the ground.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "During the minute or so that followed I reflected a good deal, as we do\r\n",
      "in times of emergency, often after a useless sort of a fashion. For\r\n",
      "instance, I wondered why the brute appeared thus upon yonder mound, and\r\n",
      "the thought suggested itself to me that it was summoned thither from\r\n",
      "some neighbouring lair by the trumpet call of the dying elephant. It\r\n",
      "occurred to me even that it was a kind of king of the elephants, to\r\n",
      "which they felt bound to report themselves, as it were, in the hour of\r\n",
      "their decease. Certainly what followed gave some credence to my\r\n",
      "fantastical notion which, if there were anything in it, might account\r\n",
      "for this great graveyard at that particular spot.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After standing for a while in the attitude that I have described,\r\n",
      "testing the air with its trunk, Jana, for I will call him so, lumbered\r\n",
      "down the mound and advanced straight to where the elephant that I had\r\n",
      "thought to be dead was kneeling. As a matter of fact it was not quite\r\n",
      "dead, for when Jana arrived it lifted its trunk and curled it round\r\n",
      "that of Jana as though in affectionate greeting, then let it fall to\r\n",
      "the ground again. Thereon Jana did what I had seen it do in my dream or\r\n",
      "vision at Ragnall, namely, attacked it, knocking it over on to its\r\n",
      "side, where it lay motionless; quite dead this time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now I remembered that the vision was not accurate after all, since in\r\n",
      "it I had seen Jana destroy a woman and a child, who on the present\r\n",
      "occasion were wanting. Since then I have thought that this was because\r\n",
      "HarÃ»t, clairvoyantly or telepathically, had conveyed to me, as indeed\r\n",
      "MarÃ»t declared, a scene which he had witnessed similar to that which I\r\n",
      "was witnessing, but not identical in its incidents. Thus it happened,\r\n",
      "perhaps, that while the act of the woman and the child was omitted, in\r\n",
      "our case there was another act of the play to follow of which I had\r\n",
      "received no inkling in my Ragnall experience. Indeed, if I had received\r\n",
      "it, I should not have been there that night, for no inducement on earth\r\n",
      "would have brought me to Kendahland.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was the act. Jana, having prodded his dead brother to his\r\n",
      "satisfaction, whether from viciousness or to put it out of pain, I\r\n",
      "cannot say, stood over the carcass in an attitude of grief or pious\r\n",
      "meditation. At this time, I should mention, the wind, which had been\r\n",
      "rustling the hail-stripped reeds at the lake border, had died away\r\n",
      "almost, but not completely; that is to say, only a very faint gust blew\r\n",
      "now and again, which, with a hunterâs instinct, I observed with\r\n",
      "satisfaction drew _from_ the direction of Jana towards ourselves. This\r\n",
      "I knew, because it struck on my forehead, which was wet with\r\n",
      "perspiration, and cooled the skin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Presently, however, by a cursed spite of fate, one of these gustsâa\r\n",
      "very little oneâcame from some quarter behind us, for I felt it in my\r\n",
      "back hair, that was as damp as the rest of me. Just then I was glancing\r\n",
      "to my right, where it seemed to me that out of the corner of my eye I\r\n",
      "had caught sight of something passing among the stones at a distance of\r\n",
      "a hundred yards or so, possibly the shadow of a cloud or another\r\n",
      "elephant. At the time I did not ascertain which it was, since a faint\r\n",
      "rattle from Janaâs trunk reconcentrated all my faculties on him in a\r\n",
      "painfully vivid fashion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I looked to see that all the contemplation had departed from his\r\n",
      "attitude, now as alert as that of a fox-terrier which imagines he has\r\n",
      "seen a rat. His vast ears were cocked, his huge bulk trembled, his\r\n",
      "enormous trunk sniffed the air.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âGreat Heavens!â thought I to myself, âhe has winded us!â Then I took\r\n",
      "such consolation as I could from the fact that the next gust once more\r\n",
      "struck upon my forehead, for I hoped he would conclude that he had made\r\n",
      "a mistake.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Not a bit of it! Jana was far too old a birdâor beastâto make any\r\n",
      "mistake. He grunted, got himself going like a luggage train, and with\r\n",
      "great deliberation walked towards us, smelling at the ground, smelling\r\n",
      "at the air, smelling to the right, to the left, and even towards heaven\r\n",
      "above, as though he expected that thence might fall upon him vengeance\r\n",
      "for his many sins. A dozen times as he came did I cover him with an\r\n",
      "imaginary rifle, marking the exact spots where I might have hoped to\r\n",
      "send a bullet to his vitals, in a kind of automatic fashion, for all my\r\n",
      "real brain was contemplating my own approaching end.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I wondered how it would happen. Would he drive that great tusk through\r\n",
      "me, would he throw me into the air, or would he kneel upon my poor\r\n",
      "little body, and avenge the deaths of his kin that had fallen at my\r\n",
      "hands? MarÃ»t was speaking in a rattling whisper:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âHis priests have told Jana to kill us; we are about to die,â he said.\r\n",
      "âBefore I die I want to say that the lady, the wife of the lordâââ\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âSilence!â I hissed. âHe will hear you,â for at that instant I took not\r\n",
      "the slightest interest in any lady on the earth. Fiercely I glared at\r\n",
      "MarÃ»t and noted even then how pitiful was his countenance. There was no\r\n",
      "smile there now. All its jovial roundness had vanished. It had sunk in;\r\n",
      "it was blue and ghastly with large, protruding eyes, like to that of a\r\n",
      "man who had been three days dead.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was rightâJana _had_ heard. Low as the whisper was, through that\r\n",
      "intense silence it had penetrated to his almost preternatural senses.\r\n",
      "Forward he came at a run for twenty paces or more with his trunk held\r\n",
      "straight out in front of him. Then he halted again, perhaps the length\r\n",
      "of a cricket pitch away, and smelt as before.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The sight was too much for MarÃ»t. He sprang up and ran for his life\r\n",
      "towards the lake, purposing, I suppose, to take refuge in the water.\r\n",
      "Oh! how he ran. After him went Jana like a railway engineâexpress this\r\n",
      "timeâtrumpeting as he charged. MarÃ»t reached the lake, which was quite\r\n",
      "close, about ten yards ahead, and plunging into it with a bound, began\r\n",
      "to swim.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, I thought, he may get away if the crocodiles donât have him, for\r\n",
      "that devil will scarcely take to the water. But this was just where I\r\n",
      "made a mistake, for with a mighty splash in went Jana too. Also he was\r\n",
      "the better swimmer. MarÃ»t soon saw this and swung round to the shore,\r\n",
      "by which manoeuvre he gained a little as he could turn quicker than\r\n",
      "Jana.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Back they came, Jana just behind MarÃ»t, striking at him with his great\r\n",
      "trunk. They landed, MarÃ»t flew a few yards ahead doubling in and out\r\n",
      "among the rocks like a hare and, to my horror, making for where I lay,\r\n",
      "whether by accident or in a mad hope of obtaining protection, I do not\r\n",
      "know.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It may be asked why I had not taken the opportunity to run also in the\r\n",
      "opposite direction. There are several answers. The first was that there\r\n",
      "seemed to be nowhere to run; the second, that I felt sure, if I did\r\n",
      "run, I should trip up over the skeletons of those elephants or the\r\n",
      "stones; the third, that I did not think of it at once; the fourth, that\r\n",
      "Jana had not yet seen me, and I had no craving to introduce myself to\r\n",
      "him personally; and the fifth and greatest, that I was so paralysed\r\n",
      "with fear that I did not feel as though I could lift myself from the\r\n",
      "ground. Everything about me seemed to be dead, except my powers of\r\n",
      "observation, which were painfully alive.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Of a sudden MarÃ»t gave up. Less than a stoneâs throw from me he wheeled\r\n",
      "round and, facing Jana, hurled at him some fearful and concentrated\r\n",
      "curse, of which all that I could distinguish were the words: âThe\r\n",
      "Child!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oddly enough it seemed to have an effect upon the furious rogue, which\r\n",
      "halted in its rush and, putting its four feet together, slid a few\r\n",
      "paces nearer and stood still. It was just as though the beast had\r\n",
      "understood the words and were considering them. If so, their effect was\r\n",
      "to rouse him to perfect madness. He screamed terribly; he lashed his\r\n",
      "sides with his trunk; his red and wicked eyes rolled; foam flew from\r\n",
      "the cavern of his open mouth; he danced upon his great feet, a sort of\r\n",
      "hideous Scottish reel. Then he charged!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I shut my eyes for a moment. When I opened them again it was to see\r\n",
      "poor MarÃ»t higher in the air than ever he flew before. I thought that\r\n",
      "he would never come down, but he did at last with an awesome thud. Jana\r\n",
      "went to him and very gently, now that he was dead, picked him up in his\r\n",
      "trunk. I prayed that he might carry him away to some hiding-place and\r\n",
      "leave me in peace. But not so. With slow and stately strides, rocking\r\n",
      "the deceased MarÃ»t up and down in his trunk, as a nurse might rock a\r\n",
      "baby, he marched on to the very stone where I lay, behind which I\r\n",
      "suppose he had seen or smelt me all the time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For quite a long while, it seemed more than a century, he stood over\r\n",
      "me, studying me as though I interested him very much, the water of the\r\n",
      "lake trickling in a refreshing stream from his great ears on to my\r\n",
      "back. Had it not been for that water I think I should have fainted, but\r\n",
      "as it was I did the next best thingâpretended to be dead. Perhaps this\r\n",
      "monster would scorn to touch a dead man. Watching out of the corner of\r\n",
      "my eye, I saw him lift one vast paw that was the size of an arm-chair\r\n",
      "and hold it over me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now good-bye to the world, thought I. Then the foot descended as a\r\n",
      "steam-hammer does, but also as a steam-hammer sometimes does when used\r\n",
      "to crack nuts, stopped as it touched my back, and presently came to\r\n",
      "earth again alongside of me, perhaps because Jana thought the foothold\r\n",
      "dangerous. At any rate, he took another and better way. Depositing the\r\n",
      "remains of MarÃ»t with the most tender care beside me, as though the\r\n",
      "nurse were putting the child to bed, he unwound his yards of trunk and\r\n",
      "began to feel me all over with its tip, commencing at the back of my\r\n",
      "neck. Oh! the sensation of that clammy, wriggling tip upon my spinal\r\n",
      "column!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Down it went till it reached the seat of my trousers. There it pinched,\r\n",
      "presumably to ascertain whether or no I were malingering, a most\r\n",
      "agonizing pinch like to that of a pair of blacksmithâs tongs. So sharp\r\n",
      "was it that, although I did not stir, who was aware that the slightest\r\n",
      "movement meant death, it tore a piece out of the stout cloth of my\r\n",
      "breeches, to say nothing of a portion of the skin beneath. This seemed\r\n",
      "to astonish the beast, for it lifted the tip of its trunk and shifted\r\n",
      "its head, as though to examine the fragment by the light of the moon.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now indeed all was over, for when it saw blood upon that clothââ! I put\r\n",
      "up one short, piteous prayer to Heaven to save me from this terrible\r\n",
      "end, and lo, it was answered!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For just as Jana, the results of the inspection being unsatisfactory,\r\n",
      "was cocking his ears and making ready to slay me, there rang out the\r\n",
      "short, sharp report of a rifle fired within a few yards. Glancing up at\r\n",
      "the instant, I saw blood spurt from the monsterâs left eye, where\r\n",
      "evidently the bullet had found a home.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He felt at his eye with his trunk; then, uttering a scream of pain,\r\n",
      "wheeled round and rushed away.\r\n",

      "I suppose that I swooned for a minute or two. At any rate I remember a\r\n",
      "long and very curious dream, such a dream as is evolved by a patient\r\n",
      "under laughing gas, that is very clear and vivid at the time but\r\n",
      "immediately afterwards slips from the mindâs grasp as water does from\r\n",
      "the clenched hand. It was something to the effect that all those\r\n",
      "hundreds of skeleton elephants rose and marshalled themselves before\r\n",
      "me, making obeisance to me by bending their bony knees, because, as I\r\n",
      "quite understood, I was the only human being that had ever escaped from\r\n",
      "Jana. Moreover, on the foremost elephantâs skull Hans was perched like\r\n",
      "a mahout, giving words of command to their serried ranks and explaining\r\n",
      "to them that it would be very convenient if they would carry their\r\n",
      "tusks, for which they had no further use, and pile them in a certain\r\n",
      "placeâI forget whereâthat must be near a good road to facilitate their\r\n",
      "subsequent transport to a land where they would be made into billiard\r\n",
      "balls and the backs of ladiesâ hair-brushes. Next, through the figments\r\n",
      "of that retreating dream, I heard the undoubted voice of Hans himself,\r\n",
      "which of course I knew to be absurd as Hans was lost and doubtless\r\n",
      "dead, saying:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIf you are alive, Baas, please wake up soon, as I have finished\r\n",
      "reloading Intombi, and it is time to be going. I think I hit Jana in\r\n",
      "the eye, but so big a beast will soon get over so little a thing as\r\n",
      "that and look for us, and the bullet from Intombi is too small to kill\r\n",
      "him, Baas, especially as it is not likely that either of us could hit\r\n",
      "him in the other eye.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now I sat up and stared. Yes, there was Hans himself looking just the\r\n",
      "same as usual, only perhaps rather dirtier, engaged in setting a cap on\r\n",
      "to the nipple of the little rifle Intombi.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âHans,â I said in a hollow voice, âwhy the devil are you here?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âTo save you from the devil, of course, Baas,â he replied aptly. Then,\r\n",
      "resting the gun against the stone, the old fellow knelt down by my side\r\n",
      "and, throwing his arms around me, began to blubber over me, exclaiming:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âJust in time, Baas! Only just in time, for as usual Hans made a mess\r\n",
      "of things and judged badlyâIâll tell you afterwards. Still, just in\r\n",
      "time, thanks be to your reverend father, the Predikant. Oh! if he had\r\n",
      "delayed me for one more minute you would have been as flat as my nose,\r\n",
      "Baas. Now come quickly. Iâve got the camel tied up there, and he can\r\n",
      "carry two, being fat and strong after four daysâ rest with plenty to\r\n",
      "eat. This place is haunted, Baas, and that king of the devils, Jana,\r\n",
      "will be back after us presently, as soon as he has wiped the blood out\r\n",
      "of his eye.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I didnât make any remark, having no taste for conversation just then,\r\n",
      "but only looked at poor MarÃ»t, who lay by me as though he was sleeping.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âOh, Baas,â said Hans, âthere is no need to trouble about him, for his\r\n",
      "neck is broken and heâs quite dead. Also it is as well,â he added\r\n",
      "cheerfully. âFor, as your reverend father doubtless remembered, the\r\n",
      "camel could never carry three. Moreover, if he stops here, perhaps Jana\r\n",
      "will come back to play with him instead of following us.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Poor MarÃ»t! This was his requiem as sung by Hans.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With a last glance at the unhappy man to whom I had grown attached in a\r\n",
      "way during our time of joint captivity and trial, I took the arm of the\r\n",
      "old Hottentot, or rather leant upon his shoulder, for at first I felt\r\n",
      "too weak to walk by myself, and picked my path with him through the\r\n",
      "stones and skeletons of elephants across the plateau eastwards, that\r\n",
      "is, away from the lake. About two hundred yards from the scene of our\r\n",
      "tragedy was a mound of rock similar to that on which Jana had appeared,\r\n",
      "but much smaller, behind which we found the camel, kneeling as a\r\n",
      "well-trained beast of the sort should do and tethered to a stone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As we went, in brief but sufficient language Hans told me his story. It\r\n",
      "seemed that after he had shot the Kendah general it came into his\r\n",
      "cunning, foreseeing mind that he might be of more use to me free than\r\n",
      "as a companion in captivity, or that if I were killed he might in that\r\n",
      "case live to bring vengeance on my slayers. So he broke away, as has\r\n",
      "been described, and hid till nightfall on the hill-side. Then by the\r\n",
      "light of the moon he tracked us, avoiding the villages, and ultimately\r\n",
      "found a place of shelter in a kind of cave in the forest near to Simba\r\n",
      "Town, where no people lived. Here he fed the camel at night, concealing\r\n",
      "it at dawn in the cave. The days he spent up a tall tree, whence he\r\n",
      "could watch all that went on in the town beneath, living meanwhile on\r\n",
      "some food which he carried in a bag tied to the saddle, helped out by\r\n",
      "green mealies which he stole from a neighbouring field.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus he saw most of what passed in the town, including the desolation\r\n",
      "wrought by the fearful tempest of hail, which, being in their cave,\r\n",
      "both he and the camel escaped without harm. On the next evening from\r\n",
      "his post of outlook up the tree, where he had now some difficulty in\r\n",
      "hiding himself because the hail had stripped off all its leaves, he saw\r\n",
      "MarÃ»t and myself brought from the guest-house and taken away by the\r\n",
      "escort. Descending and running to the cave, he saddled the camel and\r\n",
      "started in pursuit, plunging into the forest and hiding there when he\r\n",
      "perceived that the escort were leaving us.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Here he waited until they had gone by on their return journey. So close\r\n",
      "did they pass to him that he could overhear their talk, which told him\r\n",
      "they expected, or rather were sure, that we should be destroyed by the\r\n",
      "elephant Jana, their devil god, to whom the camelmen had been already\r\n",
      "sacrificed. After they had departed he remounted and followed us. Here\r\n",
      "I asked him why he had not overtaken us before we came to the cemetery\r\n",
      "of elephants, as I presumed he might have done, since he stated that he\r\n",
      "was close in our rear. This indeed was the case, for it was the head of\r\n",
      "the camel I saw behind the thorn trees when I looked back, and not the\r\n",
      "trunk of an elephant as I had supposed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At the time he would give me no direct answer, except that he grew\r\n",
      "muddled as he had already suggested, and thought it best to keep in the\r\n",
      "background and see what happened. Long afterwards, however, he admitted\r\n",
      "to me that he acted on a presentiment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIt seemed to me, Baas,â he said, âthat your reverend father was\r\n",
      "telling me that I should do best to let you two go on and not show\r\n",
      "myself, since if I did so we should all three be killed, as one of us\r\n",
      "must walk whom the other two could not desert. Whereas if I left you as\r\n",
      "you were, one of you would be killed and the other escape, and that the\r\n",
      "one to be killed would not be _you_, Baas. All of which came about as\r\n",
      "the Spirit spoke in my head, for MarÃ»t was killed, who did not matter,\r\n",
      "andâyou know the rest, Baas.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To return to Hansâ story. He saw us march down to the borders of the\r\n",
      "lake, and, keeping to our right, took cover behind the knoll of rock,\r\n",
      "whence he watched also all that followed. When Jana advanced to attack\r\n",
      "us Hans crept forward in the hope, a very wild one, of crippling him\r\n",
      "with the little Purdey rifle. Indeed, he was about to fire at the hind\r\n",
      "leg when MarÃ»t made his run for life and plunged into the lake. Then he\r\n",
      "crawled on to lead me away to the camel, but when he was within a few\r\n",
      "yards the chase returned our way and MarÃ»t was killed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "From that moment he waited for an opportunity to shoot Jana in the only\r\n",
      "spot where so soft a bullet would, as he knew, have the faintest chance\r\n",
      "of injuring him vitallyânamely, in the eyeâfor he was sure that its\r\n",
      "penetration would not be sufficient to reach the vitals through that\r\n",
      "thick hide and the mass of flesh behind. With an infinite and wonderful\r\n",
      "patience he waited, knowing that my life or death hung in the balance.\r\n",
      "While Jana held his foot over me, while he felt me with his trunk,\r\n",
      "still Hans waited, balancing the arguments for and against firing upon\r\n",
      "the scales of experience in his clever old mind, and in the end coming\r\n",
      "to a right and wise conclusion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At length his chance came, the brute exposed his eye, and by the light\r\n",
      "of the clear moon Hans, always a very good shot at a distance when it\r\n",
      "was not necessary to allow for trajectory and wind, let drive and\r\n",
      "_hit_. The bullet did not get to the brain as he had hoped; it had not\r\n",
      "strength for that, but it destroyed this left eye and gave Jana such\r\n",
      "pain that for a while he forgot all about me and everything else except\r\n",
      "escape.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Such was the Hottentotâs tale as I picked it up from his laconic,\r\n",
      "colourless, Dutch _patois_ sentences, then and afterwards; a very\r\n",
      "wonderful tale I thought. But for him, his fidelity and his bushmanâs\r\n",
      "cunning, where should I have found myself before that moon set?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We mounted the camel after I had paused a minute to take a pull from a\r\n",
      "flask of brandy which remained in the saddlebags. Although he loved\r\n",
      "strong drink so well Hans had saved it untouched on the mere chance\r\n",
      "that it might some time be of service to me, his master. The\r\n",
      "monkey-like Hottentot sat in front and directed the camel, while I\r\n",
      "accommodated myself as best I could on the sheepskins behind. Luckily\r\n",
      "they were thick and soft, for Janaâs pinch was not exactly that of a\r\n",
      "lover.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Off we went, picking our way carefully till we reached the elephant\r\n",
      "track beyond the mound where Jana had appeared, which, in the light of\r\n",
      "faith, we hoped would lead us to the River Tava. Here we made better\r\n",
      "progress, but still could not go very fast because of the holes made by\r\n",
      "the feet of Jana and his company. Soon we had left the cemetery behind\r\n",
      "us, and lost sight of the lake which I devoutly trusted I might never\r\n",
      "see again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now the track ran upwards from the hollow to a ridge two or three miles\r\n",
      "away. We reached the crest of this ridge without accident, except that\r\n",
      "on our road we met another aged elephant, a cow with very poor tusks,\r\n",
      "travelling to its last resting place, or so I suppose. I donât know\r\n",
      "which was the more frightened, the sick cow or the camel, for camels\r\n",
      "hate elephants as horses hate camels until they get used to them. The\r\n",
      "cow bolted to the right as quickly as it could, which was not very\r\n",
      "fast, and the camel bolted to the left with such convulsive bounds that\r\n",
      "we were nearly thrown off its back. However, being an equable brute, it\r\n",
      "soon recovered its balance, and we got back to the track beyond the\r\n",
      "cow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "From the top of the rise we saw that before us lay a sandy plain\r\n",
      "lightly clothed in grass, and, to our joy, about ten miles away at the\r\n",
      "foot of a very gentle slope, the moonlight gleamed upon the waters of a\r\n",
      "broad river. It was not easy to make out, but it was there, we were\r\n",
      "both sure it was there; we could not mistake the wavering, silver\r\n",
      "flash. On we went for another quarter of a mile, when something caused\r\n",
      "me to turn round on the sheepskin and look back.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oh Heavens! At the very top of the rise, clearly outlined against the\r\n",
      "sky, stood Jana himself with his trunk lifted. Next instant he\r\n",
      "trumpeted, a furious, rattling challenge of rage and defiance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAllemagte! Baas,â said Hans, âthe old devil is coming to look for his\r\n",
      "lost eye, and has seen us with that which remains. He has been\r\n",
      "travelling on our spoor.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âForward!â I answered, bringing my heels into the camelâs ribs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then the race began. The camel was a very good camel, one of the real\r\n",
      "running breed; also, as Hans said, it was comparatively fresh, and may,\r\n",
      "moreover, have been aware that it was near to the plains where it had\r\n",
      "been bred. Lastly, the going was now excellent, soft to its spongy feet\r\n",
      "but not too deep in sand, nor were there any rocks over which it could\r\n",
      "fall. It went off like the wind, making nothing of our united weights\r\n",
      "which did not come to more than two hundred pounds, or a half of what\r\n",
      "it could carry with ease, being perhaps urged to its top speed by the\r\n",
      "knowledge that the elephant was behind. For mile after mile we rushed\r\n",
      "down the plain. But we did not go alone, for Jana came after us like a\r\n",
      "cruiser after a gunboat. Moreover, swiftly as we travelled, he\r\n",
      "travelled just a little swifter, gaining say a few yards in every\r\n",
      "hundred. For the last mile before we came to the river bank, half an\r\n",
      "hour later perhaps, though it seemed to be a week, he was not more than\r\n",
      "fifty paces to our rear. I glanced back at him, and in the light of the\r\n",
      "moon, which was growing low, he bore a strange resemblance to a mud\r\n",
      "cottage with broken chimneys (which were his ears flapping on each side\r\n",
      "of him), and the yard pump projecting from the upper window.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWe shall beat him now, Hans,â I said looking at the broad river which\r\n",
      "was now close at hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYes, Baas,â answered Hans doubtfully and in jerks. âThis is very good\r\n",
      "camel, Baas. He runs so fast that I have no inside left, I suppose\r\n",
      "because he smells his wife over that river, to say nothing of death\r\n",
      "behind him. But, Baas, I am not sure; that devil Jana is still faster\r\n",
      "than the camel, and he wants to settle for his lost eye, which makes\r\n",
      "him lively. Also I see stones ahead, which are bad for camels. Then\r\n",
      "there is the river, and I donât know if camels can swim, but Jana can\r\n",
      "as MarÃ»t learned. Do you think, Baas, that you could manage to sting\r\n",
      "him up with a bullet in his knee or that great trunk of his, just to\r\n",
      "give him something to think about besides ourselves?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus he prattled on, I believe to occupy my mind and his own, till at\r\n",
      "length, growing impatient, I replied:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âBe silent, donkey. Can I shoot an elephant backwards over my shoulder\r\n",
      "with a rifle meant for springbuck? Hit the camel! Hit it hard!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Alas! Hans was right! There _were_ stones at the verge of the river,\r\n",
      "which doubtless it had washed out in periods of past flood, and\r\n",
      "presently we were among them. Now a camel, so good on sand that is its\r\n",
      "native heath, is a worthless brute among stones, over which it slips\r\n",
      "and flounders. But to Jana these appeared to offer little or no\r\n",
      "obstacle. At any rate he came over them almost if not quite as fast as\r\n",
      "before. By the time that we reached the brink of the water he was not\r\n",
      "more than ten yards behind. I could even see the blood running down\r\n",
      "from the socket of his ruined eye.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Moreover, at the sight of the foaming but shallow torrent, the camel, a\r\n",
      "creature unaccustomed to water, pulled up in a mulish kind of way and\r\n",
      "for a moment refused to stir. Luckily at this instant Jana let off one\r\n",
      "of his archangel kind of trumpetings which started our beast again,\r\n",
      "since it was more afraid of elephants than it was of water.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In we went and were presently floundering among the loose stones at the\r\n",
      "bottom of the river, which was nowhere over four feet deep, with Jana\r\n",
      "splashing after us not more than five yards behind. I twisted myself\r\n",
      "round and fired at him with the rifle. Whether I hit him or no I could\r\n",
      "not say, but he stopped for a few seconds, perhaps because he\r\n",
      "remembered the effect of a similar explosion upon his eye, which gave\r\n",
      "us a trifling start. Then he came on again in his steam-engine fashion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When we were about in the middle of the river the inevitable happened.\r\n",
      "The camel fell, pitching us over its head into the stream. Still\r\n",
      "clinging to the rifle I picked myself up and began half to swim half to\r\n",
      "wade towards the farther shore, catching hold of Hans with my free\r\n",
      "hand. In a moment Jana was on to that camel. He gored it with his\r\n",
      "tusks, he trampled it with his feet, he got it round the neck with his\r\n",
      "trunk, dragging nearly the whole bulk of it out of the water. Then he\r\n",
      "set to work to pound it down into the mud and stones at the bottom of\r\n",
      "the river with such a persistent thoroughness, that he gave us time to\r\n",
      "reach the other bank and climb up a stout tree which grew there, a\r\n",
      "sloping, flat-topped kind of tree that was fortunately easy to ascend,\r\n",
      "at least for a man. Here we sat gasping, perhaps about thirty feet\r\n",
      "above the ground level, and waited.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Presently Jana, having finished with the camel, followed us, and\r\n",
      "without any difficulty located us in that tree. He walked all round it\r\n",
      "considering the situation. Then he wound his huge trunk about the bole\r\n",
      "of the tree and, putting out his strength, tried to pull it over. It\r\n",
      "was an anxious moment, but this particular child of the forest had not\r\n",
      "grown there for some hundreds of years, withstanding all the shocks of\r\n",
      "wind, weather and water, in order to be laid low by an elephant,\r\n",
      "however enormous. It shook a littleâno more. Abandoning this attempt as\r\n",
      "futile, Jana next began to try to dig it up by driving his tusk under\r\n",
      "its roots. Here, too, he failed because they grew among stones which\r\n",
      "evidently jarred him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ceasing from these agricultural efforts with a deep rumble of rage, he\r\n",
      "adopted yet a third expedient. Rearing his huge bulk into the air he\r\n",
      "brought down his forefeet with all the tremendous weight of his great\r\n",
      "body behind them on to the sloping trunk of the tree just below where\r\n",
      "the branches sprang, perhaps twelve or thirteen feet above the ground.\r\n",
      "The shock was so heavy that for a moment I thought the tree would be\r\n",
      "uprooted or snapped in two. Thank Heaven! it held, but the vibration\r\n",
      "was such that Hans and I were nearly shaken out of the upper branches,\r\n",
      "like autumn apples from a bough. Indeed, I think I should have gone had\r\n",
      "not the monkey-like Hans, who had toes to cling with as well as\r\n",
      "fingers, gripped me by the collar.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thrice did Jana repeat this manoeuvre, and at the third onslaught I saw\r\n",
      "to my horror that the roots were loosening. I heard some of them snap,\r\n",
      "and a crack appeared in the ground not far from the bole. Fortunately\r\n",
      "Jana never noted these symptoms, for abandoning a plan which he\r\n",
      "considered unavailing, he stood for a while swaying his trunk and lost\r\n",
      "in gentle thought.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âHans,â I whispered, âload the rifle quick! I can get him in the spine\r\n",
      "or the other eye.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWet powder wonât go off, Baas,â groaned Hans. âThe water got to it in\r\n",
      "the river.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNo,â I answered, âand it is all your fault for making me shoot at him\r\n",
      "when I could take no aim.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIt would have been just the same, Baas, for the rifle went under water\r\n",
      "also when we fell from the camel, and the cap would have been damp, and\r\n",
      "perhaps the powder too. Also the shot made Jana stop for a moment.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was true, but it was maddening to be obliged to sit there with an\r\n",
      "empty gun, when if I had but one charge, or even my pistol, I was sure\r\n",
      "that I could have blinded or crippled this satanic pachyderm.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A few minutes later Jana played his last card. Coming quite close to\r\n",
      "the trunk of the tree he reared himself up as before, but this time\r\n",
      "stretched out his forelegs so that these and his body were supported on\r\n",
      "the broad bole. Then he elongated his trunk and with it began to break\r\n",
      "off boughs which grew between us and him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI donât think he can reach us,â I said doubtfully to Hans, âthat is,\r\n",
      "unless he brings a stone to stand on.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âOh! Baas, pray be silent,â answered Hans, âor he will understand and\r\n",
      "fetch one.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Although the idea seemed absurd, on the whole I thought it well to take\r\n",
      "the hint, for who knew how much this experienced beast did or did not\r\n",
      "understand? Then, as we could go no higher, we wriggled as far as we\r\n",
      "dared along our boughs and waited.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Presently Jana, having finished his clearing operations, began to\r\n",
      "lengthen his trunk to its full measure. Literally, it seemed to expand\r\n",
      "like a telescope or an indiarubber ring. Out it came, foot after foot,\r\n",
      "till its snapping tip was waving within a few inches of us, just short\r\n",
      "of my foot and Hansâs head, or rather felt hat. One final stretch and he\r\n",
      "reached the hat, which he removed with a flourish and thrust into the\r\n",
      "red cavern of his mouth. As it appeared no more I suppose he ate it.\r\n",
      "This loss of his hat moved Hans to fury. Hurling horrible curses at\r\n",
      "Jana he drew his butcherâs knife and made ready.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Once more the sinuous brown trunk elongated itself. Evidently Jana had\r\n",
      "got a better hold with his hind legs this time, or perhaps had actually\r\n",
      "wriggled himself a few inches up the tree. At any rate I saw to my\r\n",
      "dismay that there was every prospect of my making a second acquaintance\r\n",
      "with that snapping tip. The end of the trunk was lying along my bough\r\n",
      "like a huge brown snake and creeping up, up, up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âHeâll get us,â I muttered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Hans said nothing but leaned forward a little, holding on with his left\r\n",
      "hand. Next instant in the light of the rising sun I saw a knife flash,\r\n",
      "saw also that the point of it had been driven through the lower lip of\r\n",
      "Janaâs trunk, pinning it to the bough like a butterfly to a board.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My word! what a commotion ensued! Up the trunk came a scream which\r\n",
      "nearly blew me away. Then Jana, with a wriggling motion, tried to\r\n",
      "unnail himself as gently as possible, for it was clear that the knife\r\n",
      "point hurt him, but could not do so because Hans still held the handle\r\n",
      "and had driven the blade deep into the wood. Lastly he dragged himself\r\n",
      "downwards with such energy that something had to go, that something\r\n",
      "being the skin and muscle of the lower lip, which was cut clean\r\n",
      "through, leaving the knife erect in the bough.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Over he went backwards, a most imperial cropper. Then he picked himself\r\n",
      "up, thrust the tip of his trunk into his mouth, sucked it as one does a\r\n",
      "cut finger, and finally, roaring in defeated rage, fled into the river,\r\n",
      "which he waded, and back upon his tracks towards his own home. Yes, off\r\n",
      "he went, Hans screaming curses and demands that he should restore his\r\n",
      "hat to him, and very seldom in all my life have I seen a sight that I\r\n",
      "thought more beautiful than that of his whisking tail.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNow, Baas,â chuckled Hans, âthe old devil has got a sore nose as well\r\n",
      "as a sore eye by which to remember us. And, Baas, I think we had better\r\n",
      "be going before he has time to think and comes back with a long stick\r\n",
      "to knock us out of this tree.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So we went, in double-quick time I can assure you, or at any rate as\r\n",
      "fast as my stiff limbs and general condition would allow. Fortunately\r\n",
      "we had now no doubt as to our direction, since standing up through the\r\n",
      "mists of dawn with the sunbeams resting on its forest-clad crest, we\r\n",
      "could clearly see the strange, tumulus-shaped hill which the White\r\n",
      "Kendah called the Holy Mount, the Home of the Child. It appeared to be\r\n",
      "about twenty miles away, but in reality was a good deal farther, for\r\n",
      "when we had walked for several hours it seemed almost as distant as\r\n",
      "ever.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In truth that was a dreadful trudge. Not only was I exhausted with all\r\n",
      "the terrors I had passed and our long midnight flight, but the wound\r\n",
      "where Jana had pinched out a portion of my frame, inflamed by the\r\n",
      "riding, had now grown stiff and intolerably sore, so that every step\r\n",
      "gave me pain which sometimes culminated in agony. Moreover, it was no\r\n",
      "use giving in, foodless as we were, for MarÃ»t had carried the\r\n",
      "provisions, and with the chance of Jana returning to look us up. So I\r\n",
      "stuck to it and said nothing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For the first ten miles the country seemed uninhabited; doubtless it\r\n",
      "was too near the borders of the Black Kendah to be popular as a place\r\n",
      "of residence. After this we saw herds of cattle and a few camels,\r\n",
      "apparently untended; perhaps their guards were hidden away in the long\r\n",
      "grass. Then we came to some fields of mealies that were, I noticed,\r\n",
      "quite untouched by the hailstorm, which, it would seem, had confined\r\n",
      "its attentions to the land of the Black Kendah. Of these we ate\r\n",
      "thankfully enough. A little farther on we perceived huts perched on an\r\n",
      "inaccessible place in a kloof. Also their inhabitants perceived us, for\r\n",
      "they ran away as though in a great fright.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Still we did not try to approach the huts, not knowing how we should be\r\n",
      "received. After my sojourn in Simba Town I had become possessed of a\r\n",
      "love of life in the open.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For another two hours I limped forward with pain and griefâby now I was\r\n",
      "leaning on Hansâ shoulderâup an endless, uncultivated rise clothed with\r\n",
      "euphorbias and fern-like cycads. At length we reached its top and found\r\n",
      "ourselves within a rifle shot of a fenced native village. I suppose\r\n",
      "that its inhabitants had been warned of our coming by runners from the\r\n",
      "huts I have mentioned. At any rate the moment we appeared the men, to\r\n",
      "the number of thirty or more, poured out of the south gate armed with\r\n",
      "spears and other weapons and proceeded to ring us round and behave in a\r\n",
      "very threatening manner. I noticed at once that, although most of them\r\n",
      "were comparatively light in colour, some of these men partook of the\r\n",
      "negro characteristics of the Black Kendah from whom we had escaped, to\r\n",
      "such an extent indeed that this blood was clearly predominant in them.\r\n",
      "Still, it was also clear that they were deadly foes of this people, for\r\n",
      "when I shouted out to them that we were the friends of HarÃ»t and those\r\n",
      "who worshipped the Child, they yelled back that we were liars. No\r\n",
      "friends of the Child, they said, came from the country of the Black\r\n",
      "Kendah, who worshipped the devil Jana. I tried to explain that least of\r\n",
      "all men in the world did we worship Jana, who had been hunting us for\r\n",
      "hours, but they would not listen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYou are spies of Simbaâs, the smell of Jana is upon youâ (this may\r\n",
      "have been true enough), they yelled, adding: âWe will kill you,\r\n",
      "white-faced goat. We will kill you, little yellow monkey, for none who\r\n",
      "are not enemies come here from the land of the Black Kendah.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âKill us then,â I answered, âand bring the curse of the Child upon you.\r\n",
      "Bring famine, bring hail, bring war!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "These words were, I think, well chosen; at any rate they induced a\r\n",
      "pause in their murderous intentions. For a while they hesitated, all\r\n",
      "talking together at once. At last the advocates of violence appeared to\r\n",
      "get the upper hand, and once more a number of the men began to dance\r\n",
      "about us, waving their spears and crying out that we must die who came\r\n",
      "from the Black Kendah.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I sat down upon the ground, for I was so exhausted that at the time I\r\n",
      "did not greatly care whether I died or lived, while Hans drew his knife\r\n",
      "and stood over me, cursing them as he had cursed at Jana. By slow\r\n",
      "degrees they drew nearer and nearer. I watched them with a kind of idle\r\n",
      "curiosity, believing that the moment when they came within actual\r\n",
      "spear-thrust would be our last, but, as I have said, not greatly caring\r\n",
      "because of my mental and physical exhaustion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I had already closed my eyes that I might not see the flash of the\r\n",
      "falling steel, when an exclamation from Hans caused me to open them\r\n",
      "again. Following the line of the knife with which he pointed, I\r\n",
      "perceived a troop of men on camels emerging from the gates of the\r\n",
      "village at full speed. In front of these, his white garments fluttering\r\n",
      "on the wind, rode a bearded and dignified person in whom I recognized\r\n",
      "HarÃ»t, HarÃ»t himself, waving a spear and shouting as he came. Our\r\n",
      "assailants heard and saw him also, then flung down their weapons as\r\n",
      "though in dismay either at his appearance or his words, which I could\r\n",
      "not catch. HarÃ»t guided his rushing camel straight at the man who I\r\n",
      "presume was their leader, and struck at him with his spear, as though\r\n",
      "in fury, wounding him in the shoulder and causing him to fall to the\r\n",
      "ground. As he struck he called out:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âDog! Would you harm the guests of the Child?â\r\n",

      "At last I opened my eyes and observed that I lay on a low bed raised\r\n",

      "attempt to recover our bodies or even to return, that was the only\r\n",
      "thing to do, and in due course reached the Town of the Child without\r\n",

      "we appeared, had not even heard of our existence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I asked what they had done and what information they had obtained since\r\n",
      "their arrival at this place. His answer was: Nothing and none worth\r\n",
      "mentioning. The town appeared to be a small one of not much over two\r\n",
      "thousand inhabitants, all of whom were engaged in agricultural pursuits\r\n",
      "and in camel-breeding. The herds of camels, however, they gathered, for\r\n",
      "the most part were kept at outlying settlements on the farther side of\r\n",
      "the cone-shaped mountain. As they were unable to talk the language the\r\n",
      "only person from whom they could gain knowledge was HarÃ»t, who spoke to\r\n",
      "them in his broken English and told them much what he had told me,\r\n",
      "namely that the upper mountain was a sacred place that might only be\r\n",
      "visited by the priests, since any uninitiated person who set foot there\r\n",
      "came to a bad end. They had not seen any of these priests in the town,\r\n",
      "where no form of worship appeared to be practised, but they had\r\n",
      "observed men driving small numbers of sheep or goats up the flanks of\r\n",
      "the mountain towards the forest.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Of what went on upon this mountain and who lived there they remained in\r\n",
      "complete ignorance. It was a case of stalemate. HarÃ»t would not tell\r\n",
      "them anything nor could they learn anything for themselves. He added in\r\n",
      "a depressed way that the whole business seemed very hopeless, and that\r\n",
      "he had begun to doubt whether there was any tidings of his lost wife to\r\n",
      "be gained among the Kendah, White or Black.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now I repeated to him MarÃ»tâs dying words, of which most unhappily I\r\n",
      "had never heard the end. These seemed to give him new life since they\r\n",
      "showed that tidings there was of some sort, if only it could be\r\n",
      "extracted. But how might this be done? How? How?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For a whole week things went on thus. During this time I recovered my\r\n",
      "strength completely, except in one particular which reduced me to\r\n",
      "helplessness. The place on my thigh where Jana had pinched out a bit of\r\n",
      "the skin healed up well enough, but the inflammation struck inwards to\r\n",
      "the nerve of my left leg, where once I had been injured by a lion, with\r\n",
      "the result that whenever I tried to move I was tortured by pains of a\r\n",
      "sciatic nature. So I was obliged to lie still and to content myself\r\n",
      "with being carried on the bed into a little garden which surrounded the\r\n",
      "mud-built and white-washed house that had been allotted to us as a\r\n",
      "dwelling-place.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There I lay hour after hour, staring at the Holy Mount which began to\r\n",
      "spring from the plain within a few hundred yards of the scattered\r\n",
      "township. For a mile or so its slopes were bare except for grass on\r\n",
      "which sheep and goats were grazed, and a few scattered trees. Studying\r\n",
      "the place through glasses I observed that these slopes were crowned by\r\n",
      "a vertical precipice of what looked like lava rock, which seemed to\r\n",
      "surround the whole mountain and must have been quite a hundred feet\r\n",
      "high. Beyond this precipice, which to all appearance was of an\r\n",
      "unclimbable nature, began a dense forest of large trees, cedars I\r\n",
      "thought, clothing it to the very top, that is so far as I could see.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One day when I was considering the place, HarÃ»t entered the garden\r\n",
      "suddenly and caught me in the act.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThe House of the god is beautiful,â he said, âis it not?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âVery,â I answered, âand of a strange formation. But how do those who\r\n",
      "dwell on it climb that precipice?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIt cannot be climbed,â he answered, âbut there is a road which I am\r\n",
      "about to travel who go to worship the Child. Yet I have told you,\r\n",
      "Macumazana, that any strangers who seek to walk that road find death.\r\n",
      "If they do not believe me, let them try,â he added meaningly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then, after many inquiries about my health, he informed me that news\r\n",
      "had reached him to the effect that the Black Kendah were mad at the\r\n",
      "loss of their crops which the hail had destroyed and because of the\r\n",
      "near prospect of starvation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThen soon they will be wishing to reap yours with spears,â I said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThat is so. Therefore, my Lord Macumazana, get well quickly that you\r\n",
      "may be able to scare away these crows with guns, for in fourteen days\r\n",
      "the harvest should begin upon our uplands. Farewell and have no fears,\r\n",
      "for during my absence my people will feed and watch you and on the\r\n",

      "After HarÃ»tâs departure a deep depression fell upon all of us. Even\r\n",
      "Hans was depressed, while Savage became like a man under sentence of\r\n",
      "execution at a near but uncertain date. I tried to cheer him up and\r\n",
      "asked him what was the matter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI donât know, Mr. Quatermain,â he answered, âbut the fact is this is a\r\n",
      "âateful and unâoly âoleâ (in his agitation he quite lost grip of his\r\n",
      "hâs, which was always weak), âand I am sure that it is the last I shall\r\n",

      "âNo, Mr. Quatermain. That is, I havenât met any, but they crawl about\r\n",
      "me all night, and whenever I see that prophet man he talks of them to\r\n",
      "me. Yes, he talks of them and nothing else with a sort of cold look in\r\n",
      "his eyes that makes my back creep. I wish it was over, I do, who shall\r\n",

      "very painful and evident emotion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That evening Hans returned from an expedition on which I had sent him\r\n",
      "with instructions to try to get round the mountain and report what was\r\n",
      "on its other side. It had been a complete failure, as after he had gone\r\n",
      "a few miles men appeared who ordered him back. They were so threatening\r\n",
      "in their demeanour that had it not been for the little rifle, Intombi,\r\n",
      "which he carried under pretence of shooting buck, a weapon that they\r\n",
      "regarded with great awe, they would, he thought, have killed him. He\r\n",
      "added that he had been quite unsuccessful in his efforts to collect any\r\n",
      "news of value from man, woman or child, all of whom, although very\r\n",
      "polite, appeared to have orders to tell him nothing, concluding with\r\n",

      "Black Kendah, inasmuch as they were more clever.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Shortly after this abortive attempt we debated our position with\r\n",

      "happened. There were two rooms in our house divided by a partition\r\n",
      "which ran almost up to the roof. In the left-hand room slept Ragnall\r\n",
      "and Savage, and in that to the right Hans and I. Just at the breaking\r\n",
      "of dawn I was awakened by hearing some agitated conversation between\r\n",
      "Savage and his master. A minute later they both entered my sleeping\r\n",
      "place, and I saw in the faint light that Ragnall looked very disturbed\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âHow was she dressed?â I asked at once.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "her waist, but carefully combed and held outspread by what appeared to\r\n",
      "be a bent piece of ivory about a foot and a half long, to which it was\r\n",
      "fastened by a thread of gold.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIs that all?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNo. Upon her breast was that necklace of red stones with the little\r\n",

      "always wore.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAnything more?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYes. In her arms she carried what looked like a veiled child. It was\r\n",
      "so still that I think it must have been dead.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWell. What happened?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI was so overcome I could not speak, and she stood gazing at me with\r\n",
      "wide-opened eyes, looking more beautiful than I can tell you. She never\r\n",
      "stirred, and her lips never movedâthat I will swear. And yet both of us\r\n",
      "heard her say, very low but quite clearly: âThe mountain, George! Donât\r\n",
      "desert me. Seek me on the mountain, my dear, my husband.ââ\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "âThrough the door! Was it open then?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNo, sir, it was shut and bolted. She just came through it as if it\r\n",
      "wasnât there. Then I called to his lordship after she had been looking\r\n",
      "at him for half a minute or so, for I couldnât speak at first. Thereâs\r\n",
      "one more thing, or rather two. On her head was a little cap that looked\r\n",
      "as though it had been made from the skin of a bird, with a gold snake\r\n",
      "rising up in front, which snake was the first thing I caught sight of,\r\n",
      "as of course it would be, sir. Also the dress she wore was so thin that\r\n",
      "through it I could see her shape and the sandals on her feet, which\r\n",
      "were fastened at the instep with studs of gold.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI saw no feather cap or snake,â said Ragnall.\r\n",

      "I want to think things over.â\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âNow, Hans,â I said to him, âwhat is the use of you? You are no better\r\n",
      "than a fraud. You pretend to be the best watchdog in Africa, and yet a\r\n",
      "woman comes into this house under your nose and in the grey of the\r\n",
      "morning, and you do not see her. Where is your reputation, Hans?â\r\n",

      "âIt was not a woman, Baas, but a spook. Who am I that I should be\r\n",
      "expected to catch spooks as though they were thieves or rats? As it\r\n",
      "happens I was wide awake half an hour before the dawn and lay with my\r\n",
      "eyes fixed upon that door, which I bolted myself last night. It never\r\n",
      "opened, Baas; moreover, since this talk began I have been to look at\r\n",
      "it. During the night a spider has made its web from door-post to\r\n",
      "door-post, and that web is unbroken. If you do not believe me, come and\r\n",
      "see for yourself. Yet they say the woman came through the doorway and\r\n",
      "therefore through the spiderâs web. Oh! Baas, what is the use of\r\n",
      "wasting thought upon the ways of spooks which, like the wind, come and\r\n",
      "go as they will, especially in this haunted land from which, as we have\r\n",
      "all agreed, we should do well to get away.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I went and examined the door for myself, for by now my sciatica, or\r\n",
      "whatever it may have been, was so much better that I could walk a\r\n",
      "little. What Hans said was true. There was the spiderâs web with the\r\n",
      "spider sitting in the middle. Also some of the threads of the web were\r\n",
      "fixed from post to post, so that it was impossible that the door could\r\n",
      "have been opened or, if opened, that anyone could have passed through\r\n",
      "the doorway without breaking them. Therefore, unless the woman came\r\n",
      "through one of the little window-places, which was almost incredible as\r\n",
      "they were high above the ground, or dropped from the smoke-hole in the\r\n",
      "roof, or had been shut into the place when the door was closed on the\r\n",
      "previous night, I could not see how she had arrived there. And if any\r\n",

      "out again with two men watching her?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There were only two solutions to the problemânamely, that the whole\r\n",
      "occurrence was hallucination, or that, in fact, Ragnall and Savage had\r\n",
      "seen something unnatural and uncanny. If the latter were correct I only\r\n",
      "wished that I had shared the experience, as I have always longed to see\r\n",
      "a ghost. A real, indisputable ghost would be a great support to our\r\n",
      "doubting minds, that is if we _knew_ its owner to be dead.\r\n",

      "Butâthis was another thoughtâif by any chance Lady Ragnall were still\r\n",

      "that we should do well to try to escape from the place before we became\r\n",
      "involved in a war of extermination between two branches of an obscure\r\n",

      "risking our lives. I wished to face the thing alone, but that good\r\n",

      "of this hell and live to a green old age amongst Christians. Then he\r\n",
      "wiped away a tear with the cuff of his coat, touched his hat in the\r\n",
      "orthodox fashion and departed. Their outfit, I should add, was very\r\n",

      "Here we perceived a track that ran to the mouth of a narrow cave or\r\n",

      "amazed, for the man seemed to be animated by some tremendous purpose.\r\n",
      "Or rather it was as though a force from without had got hold of his\r\n",

      "reached its entrance the star of light thrown forward by the bullâs-eye\r\n",

      "the left, with a kind of horrible grace and to the tune of a hideous\r\n",
      "hissing music. I held the lantern higher and perceived that beyond him,\r\n",
      "lifted eight or nine feet into the air, nearly to the roof of the\r\n",
      "tunnel in fact, was the head of the hugest snake of which I have ever\r\n",

      "behind it, which stretched far away into the darkness, was the size of\r\n",

      "splashed with silver and with gold.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "right. It hissed again and swayed its head to the left, whereon he\r\n",
      "danced to the left. Then suddenly it reared its head right to the top\r\n",
      "of the cave and so remained for a few seconds, whereon Savage stood\r\n",

      "fangs bury themselves in the back of Savage, who with a kind of sigh\r\n",
      "fell forward on to his face. Then there was a convulsion of those\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "and taking the cover off a little earthenware pot which he produced he\r\n",
      "scooped from it with his finger some of the contents, which looked like\r\n",

      "excellent results. That night I took a dose in water, very nasty it\r\n",
      "was, and rubbed my leg with the stuff, to find that next morning all\r\n",
      "pain had left me and that, except for some local weakness, I was\r\n",
      "practically quite well. I kept the rest of the salve for years, and it\r\n",
      "proved a perfect specific in cases of sciatica and rheumatism. Now,\r\n",
      "alas! it is all used and no recipe is available from which it can be\r\n",
      "made up again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The next few days passed uneventfully. As soon as I could walk I began\r\n",
      "to go about the town, which was nothing but a scattered village much\r\n",
      "resembling those to be seen on the eastern coasts of Africa. Nearly all\r\n",
      "the men seemed to be away, making preparations for the harvest, I\r\n",

      "Oriental fashion, though the few that I saw about were unveiled and\r\n",
      "rather good-looking, I did not gather any intelligence worth noting.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To tell the truth I cannot remember being in a more uninteresting place\r\n",
      "than this little town with its extremely uncommunicative population\r\n",
      "which, it seemed to me, lived under a shadow of fear that prevented all\r\n",
      "gaiety. Even the children, of whom there were not many, crept about in\r\n",
      "a depressed fashion and talked in a low voice. I never saw any of them\r\n",
      "playing games or heard them shouting and laughing, as young people do\r\n",
      "in most parts of the world. For the rest we were very well looked\r\n",
      "after. Plenty of food was provided for us and every thought taken for\r\n",
      "our comfort. Thus a strong and quiet pony was brought for me to ride\r\n",
      "because of my lameness. I had only to go out of the house and call and\r\n",
      "it arrived from somewhere, all ready saddled and bridled, in charge of\r\n",

      "not answer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mounted on this pony I took one or two rides along the southern slopes\r\n",
      "of the mountain on the old pretext of shooting for the pot. Hans\r\n",
      "accompanied me on these occasions, but was, I noted, very silent and\r\n",
      "thoughtful, as though he were hunting something up and down his\r\n",
      "tortuous intelligence. Once we got quite near to the mouth of the cave\r\n",
      "or tunnel where poor Savage had met his horrid end. As we stood\r\n",
      "studying it a white-robed man whose head was shaved, which made me\r\n",
      "think he must be a priest, came up and asked me mockingly why we did\r\n",
      "not go through the tunnel and see what lay beyond, adding, almost in\r\n",
      "the words of HarÃ»t himself, that none would attempt to interfere with\r\n",
      "us as the road was open to any who could travel it. By way of answer I\r\n",
      "only smiled and put him a few questions about a very beautiful breed of\r\n",
      "goats with long silky hair, some of which he seemed to be engaged in\r\n",
      "herding. He replied that these goats were sacred, being the food of\r\n",
      "âone who dwelt in the Mountain who only ate when the moon changed.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When I inquired who this person was he said with his unpleasant smile\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "That evening HarÃ»t appeared unexpectedly, looking very grave and\r\n",
      "troubled. He was in a great hurry and only stayed long enough to\r\n",
      "congratulate me upon the excellent effects of his ointment, since âno\r\n",
      "man could fight Jana on one leg.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "which is held at sunrise on the day of the new moon. After the offering\r\n",
      "the Oracle will speak and we shall learn when there will be war with\r\n",

      "here?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âCertainly,â he answered with his grave bow. âThat is, if you come\r\n",
      "unarmed; for to appear before the Child with arms is death. You know\r\n",
      "the road; it runs through yonder cave and the forest beyond the cave.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âYou will be very welcome. None shall hurt you there, going or\r\n",
      "returning. I swear it by the Child. Oh! Macumazana,â he added, smiling\r\n",
      "a little, âwhy do you talk folly, who know well that one lives in\r\n",
      "yonder cave whom none may look upon and love, as Bena learned not long\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Both Ragnall and I acknowledged the force of this argument and in the\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "âThere isnât much story, Baas,â replied Hans between long sucks at his\r\n",

      "Snakes in the cave, Baas? Ah, now for the first time you see the stone\r\n",
      "that lay at your feet all the while. And, Baas, did not the bald man\r\n",
      "add that this One in the mountain was only fed at new and full moon,\r\n",
      "and is not to-morrow the day of new moon, and therefore would he not be\r\n",
      "very hungry on the day before new moon, that is, last night?â\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âOh! Baas, you may eat things that make you ill, and so can a snake.\r\n",
      "Now you will guess the rest, so I had better go to wash the dishes.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhether I guess or do not guess,â I replied sagely, the latter being\r\n",

      "has not guessed; so continue.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âVery well, Baas. In one of those boxes are some pounds of stuff which,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âYou mean the arsenic crystals,â I said with a flash of inspiration.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "hard sugar and stole some once, when the real sugar was left behind, to\r\n",
      "put into the coffeeâwithout telling the Baas, because it was my fault\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âBecause at the last moment, Baas, I thought I would make sure, so I\r\n",
      "put some of the hard sugar into hot milk and, when it had melted, I\r\n",
      "gave it to that yellow dog which once bit me in the leg, the one that\r\n",
      "came from Beza-Town, Baas, that I told you had run away. He was a very\r\n",
      "greedy dog, Baas, and drank up the milk at once. Then he gave a howl,\r\n",
      "twisted about, foamed at the mouth and died and I buried him at once.\r\n",
      "After that I threw some more of the large sugar mixed with mealies to\r\n",
      "the fowls that we brought with us for cooking. Two cocks and a hen\r\n",
      "swallowed them by mistake for the corn. Presently they fell on their\r\n",
      "backs, kicked a little and died. Some of the Mazitu, who were great\r\n",
      "thieves, stole those dead fowls, Baas. After this, Baas, I thought it\r\n",
      "best not to use that sugar in the coffee, and later on Bena told me\r\n",
      "that it was deadly poison. Well, Baas, it came into my mind that if I\r\n",
      "could make that great snake swallow enough of this poison, he, too,\r\n",
      "might die.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âSo I stole your keys, as I often do, Baas, when I want anything,\r\n",
      "because you leave them lying about everywhere, and to deceive you first\r\n",
      "opened one of the boxes that are full of square-face and brandy and\r\n",
      "left it open, for I wished you to think that I had just gone to get\r\n",
      "drunk like anybody else. Then I opened another box and got out two\r\n",
      "one-pound tins of the sugar which kills dogs and fowls. Half a pound of\r\n",
      "it I melted in boiling water with some real sugar to make the stuff\r\n",
      "sweet, and put it into a bottle. The rest I tied with string in twelve\r\n",
      "little packets in the soft paper which is in one of the boxes, and put\r\n",
      "them in my pocket. Then I went up the hill, Baas, to the place where I\r\n",
      "saw those goats are kraaled at night behind a reed fence. As I had\r\n",
      "hoped, no one was watching them because there are no tigers so near\r\n",
      "this town, and man does not steal the goats that are sacred. I went\r\n",
      "into the kraal and found a fat young ewe which had a kid. I dragged it\r\n",
      "out and, taking it behind some stones, I made its leg fast with a bit\r\n",
      "of cord and poured this stuff out of the bottle all over its skin,\r\n",
      "rubbing it in well. Then I tied the twelve packets of hard poison-sugar\r\n",
      "everywhere about its body, making them very fast deep in the long hair\r\n",
      "so that they could not tumble or rub off.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAfter this I untied the goat, led it near to the mouth of the cave and\r\n",
      "held it there for a time while it kept on bleating for its kid. Next I\r\n",
      "took it almost up to the cave, wondering how I should drive it in, for\r\n",
      "I did not wish to enter there myself, Baas. As it happened I need not\r\n",
      "have troubled about that. When the goat was within five yards of the\r\n",
      "cave, it stopped bleating, stood still and shivered. Then it began to\r\n",
      "go forward with little jumps, as though it did not want to go, yet must\r\n",
      "do so. Also, Baas, I felt as though _I_ wished to go with it. So I lay\r\n",
      "down and put my heels against a rock, leaving go of the goat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âFor now, Baas, I did not care where that goat went so long as I could\r\n",
      "keep out of the hole where dwelt the Father of Serpents that had eaten\r\n",
      "Bena. But it was all right, Baas; the goat knew what it had to do and\r\n",
      "did it, jumping straight into the cave. As it entered it turned its\r\n",
      "head and looked at me. I could see its eyes in the starlight, and,\r\n",
      "Baas, they were dreadful. I think it knew what was coming and did not\r\n",
      "like it at all. And yet it had to walk on because it could not help it.\r\n",
      "Just like a man going to the devil, Baas!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âHolding on to the stone I peered after it, for I had heard something\r\n",
      "stirring in the cave making a soft noise like a white ladyâs dress upon\r\n",
      "the floor. There in the blackness I saw two little sparks of fire,\r\n",
      "which were the eyes of the serpent, Baas. Then I heard a sound of\r\n",
      "hissing like four big kettles boiling all at once, and a little bleat\r\n",
      "from the goat. After this there was a noise as of men wrestling,\r\n",
      "followed by another noise as of bones breaking, and lastly, yet another\r\n",
      "sucking noise as of a pump that wonât draw up the water. Then\r\n",
      "everything grew nice and quiet and I went some way off, sat down a\r\n",
      "little to one side of the cave, and waited to see if anything happened.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIt must have been nearly an hour later that something did begin to\r\n",
      "happen, Baas. It was as though sacks filled with chaff were being\r\n",
      "beaten against stone walls there in the cave. Ah! thought I to myself,\r\n",
      "your stomach is beginning to ache, Eater-up-of-Bena, and, as that goat\r\n",
      "had little horns on its headâto which I tied two of the bags of the\r\n",
      "poison, Baasâand, like all snakes, no doubt you have spikes in your\r\n",
      "throat pointing downwards, you wonât be able to get it up again. ThenâI\r\n",
      "expect this was after the poison-sugar had begun to melt nicely in the\r\n",
      "serpentâs stomach, Baasâthere was a noise as though a whole company of\r\n",
      "girls were dancing a war-dance in the cave to a music of hisses.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAnd thenâoh! then, Baas, of a sudden that Father of Serpents came out.\r\n",
      "I tell you, Baas, that when I saw him in the bright starlight my hair\r\n",
      "stood up upon my head, for never has there been such another snake in\r\n",
      "the whole world. Those that live in trees and eat bucks in Zululand, of\r\n",
      "whose skins men make waistcoats and slippers, are but babies compared\r\n",
      "to this one. He came out, yard after yard of him. He wriggled about, he\r\n",
      "stood upon his tail with his head where the top of a tree might be, he\r\n",
      "made himself into a ring, he bit at stones and at his own stomach,\r\n",
      "while I hid behind my rock praying to your reverend father that he\r\n",
      "might not see me. Then at last he rushed away down the hill, faster\r\n",
      "than any horse could gallop.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNow I hoped that he had gone for good and thought of going myself.\r\n",
      "Still I feared to do so lest I should meet him somewhere, so I made up\r\n",
      "my mind to wait till daylight. It was as well, Baas, for about half an\r\n",
      "hour later he came back again. Only now he could not jump, he could\r\n",
      "only crawl. Never in my life did I see a snake look so sick, Baas. Into\r\n",
      "the cave he went and lay there hissing. By degrees the hissing grew\r\n",
      "very faint, till at length they died away altogether. I waited another\r\n",
      "half-hour, Baas, and then I grew so curious that I thought that I would\r\n",
      "go to look in the cave.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI lit the little lantern I had with me and, holding it in one hand and\r\n",
      "my stick in the other, I crept into the hole. Before I had crawled ten\r\n",
      "paces I saw something white stretched along the ground. It was the\r\n",
      "belly of the great snake, Baas, which lay upon its back quite dead.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI know that it was dead, for I lit three wax matches, setting them to\r\n",
      "burn upon its tail and it never stirred, as any live snake will do when\r\n",
      "it feels fire. Then I came home, Baas, feeling very proud because I had\r\n",
      "outwitted that great-grandfather of all snakes who killed Bena my\r\n",
      "friend, and had made the way clear for us to walk through the cave.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThat is all the story, Baas. Now I must go to wash those dishes,â and\r\n",
      "without waiting for any comment off he went, leaving us marvelling at\r\n",
      "his wit, resource and courage.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhat next?â I asked presently.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNothing till to-night,â answered Ragnall with determination, âwhen I\r\n",
      "am going to look at the snake which the noble Hans has killed and\r\n",
      "whatever lies beyond the cave, as you will remember HarÃ»t invited us to\r\n",
      "do unmolested, if we could.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âDo you think HarÃ»t will keep his word, Ragnall?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âOn the whole, yes, and if he doesnât I donât care. Anything is better\r\n",
      "than sitting here in this suspense.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI agree as to HarÃ»t, because we are too valuable to be killed just\r\n",
      "now, if for no other reason; also as to the suspense, which is\r\n",
      "unendurable. Therefore I will walk with you to look at that snake,\r\n",
      "Ragnall, and so no doubt will Hans. The exercise will do my leg good.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âDo you think it wise?â he asked doubtfully; âin your case, I mean.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI think it most unwise that we should separate any more. We had better\r\n",

      "apart.â\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "That evening shortly after sundown the three of us started boldly from\r\n",
      "our house wearing over our clothes the Kendah dresses which Ragnall had\r\n",
      "bought, and carrying nothing save sticks in our hands, some food and\r\n",
      "the lantern in our pockets. On the outskirts of the town we were met by\r\n",
      "certain Kendah, one of whom I knew, for I had often ridden by his side\r\n",
      "on our march across the desert.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âHave any of you arms upon you, Lord Macumazana?â he asked, looking\r\n",
      "curiously at us and our white robes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNone,â I answered. âSearch us if you will.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYour word is sufficient,â he replied with the grave courtesy of his\r\n",
      "people. âIf you are unarmed we have orders to let you go where you wish\r\n",
      "however you may be dressed. Yet, Lord,â he whispered to me, âI pray you\r\n",
      "do not enter the cave, since One lives there who strikes and does not\r\n",
      "miss, One whose kiss is death. I pray it for your own sakes, also for\r\n",
      "ours who need you.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWe shall not wake him who sleeps in the cave,â I answered\r\n",
      "enigmatically, as we departed rejoicing, for now we had learned that\r\n",
      "the Kendah did not yet know of the death of the serpent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "An hourâs walk up the hill, guided by Hans, brought us to the mouth of\r\n",
      "the tunnel. To tell the truth I could have wished it had been longer,\r\n",
      "for as we drew near all sorts of doubts assailed me. What if Hans\r\n",
      "really had been drinking and invented this story to account for his\r\n",
      "absence? What if the snake had recovered from a merely temporary\r\n",
      "indisposition? What if it had a wife and family living in that cave,\r\n",
      "every one of them thirsting for vengeance?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Well, it was too late to hesitate now, but secretly I hoped that one of\r\n",
      "the others would prefer to lead the way. We reached the place and\r\n",
      "listened. It was silent as a tomb. Then that brave fellow Hans lit the\r\n",
      "lantern and said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âDo you stop here, Baases, while I go to look. If you hear anything\r\n",
      "happen to me, you will have time to run away,â words that made me feel\r\n",
      "somewhat ashamed of myself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "However, knowing that he was quick as a weasel and silent as a cat, we\r\n",
      "let him go. A minute or two later suddenly he reappeared out of the\r\n",
      "darkness, for he had turned the metal shield over the bullâs-eye of the\r\n",
      "lantern, and even in that light I could see that he was grinning.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIt is all right, Baas,â he said. âThe Father of Serpents has really\r\n",
      "gone to that land whither he sent Bena, where no doubt he is now\r\n",
      "roasting in the fires of hell, and I donât see any others. Come and\r\n",
      "look at him.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So in we went and there, true enough, upon the floor of the cave lay\r\n",
      "the huge reptile stone dead and already much swollen. I donât know how\r\n",
      "long it was, for part of its body was twisted into coils, so I will\r\n",
      "only say that it was by far the most enormous snake that I have ever\r\n",
      "seen. It is true that I have heard of such reptiles in different parts\r\n",
      "of Africa, but hitherto I had always put them down as fabulous\r\n",
      "creatures transformed into and worshipped as local gods. Also this\r\n",
      "particular specimen was, I presume, of a new variety, since, according\r\n",
      "to Ragnall, it both struck like the cobra or the adder, and crushed\r\n",
      "like the boa-constrictor. It is possible, however, that he was mistaken\r\n",
      "on this point; I do not know, since I had no time, or indeed\r\n",
      "inclination, to examine its head for the poison fangs, and when next I\r\n",
      "passed that way it was gone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I shall never forget the stench of that cave. It was horrible, which is\r\n",
      "not to be wondered at seeing that probably this creature had dwelt\r\n",
      "there for centuries, since these large snakes are said to be as long\r\n",
      "lived as tortoises, and, being sacred, of course it had never lacked\r\n",
      "for food. Everywhere lay piles of cast bones, amongst one of which I\r\n",
      "noticed fragments of a human skull, perhaps that of poor Savage. Also\r\n",
      "the projecting rocks in the place were covered with great pieces of\r\n",
      "snake skin, doubtless rubbed off by the reptile when once a year it\r\n",
      "changed its coat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For a while we gazed at the loathsome and still glittering creature,\r\n",
      "then pushed on fearful lest we should stumble upon more of its kind. I\r\n",
      "suppose that it must have been solitary, a kind of serpent rogue, as\r\n",
      "Jana was an elephant rogue, for we met none and, if the information\r\n",
      "which I obtained afterwards may be believed, there was no species at\r\n",
      "all resembling it in the country. What its origin may have been I never\r\n",
      "learned. All the Kendah could or would say about it was that it had\r\n",
      "lived in this hole from the beginning and that Black Kendah prisoners,\r\n",
      "or malefactors, were sometimes given to it to kill, as White Kendah\r\n",
      "prisoners were given to Jana.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The cave itself proved to be not very long, perhaps one hundred and\r\n",
      "fifty feet, no more. It was not an artificial but a natural hollow in\r\n",
      "the lava rock, which I suppose had once been blown through it by an\r\n",
      "outburst of steam. Towards the farther end it narrowed so much that I\r\n",
      "began to fear there might be no exit. In this I was mistaken, however,\r\n",
      "for at its termination we found a hole just large enough for a man to\r\n",
      "walk in upright and so difficult to climb through that it became clear\r\n",
      "to us that certainly this was not the path by which the White Kendah\r\n",
      "approached their sanctuary.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Scrambling out of this aperture with thankfulness, we found ourselves\r\n",
      "upon the slope of a kind of huge ditch of lava which ran first\r\n",
      "downwards for about eighty paces, then up again to the base of the\r\n",
      "great cone of the inner mountain which was covered with dense forest.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I presume that the whole formation of this peculiar hill was the result\r\n",
      "of a violent volcanic action in the early ages of the earth. But as I\r\n",
      "do not understand such matters I will not dilate upon them further than\r\n",
      "to say that, although comparatively small, it bore a certain\r\n",
      "resemblance to other extinct volcanoes which I had met with in\r\n",
      "different parts of Africa.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We climbed down to the bottom of the ditch that from its general\r\n",
      "appearance might have been dug out by some giant race as a protection\r\n",
      "to their stronghold, and up its farther side to where the forest began\r\n",
      "on deep and fertile soil. Why there should have been rich earth here\r\n",
      "and none in the ditch is more than we could guess, but perhaps the\r\n",
      "presence of springs of water in this part of the mount may have been a\r\n",
      "cause. At any rate it was so.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The trees in this forest were huge and of a variety of cedar, but did\r\n",
      "not grow closely together; also there was practically no undergrowth,\r\n",
      "perhaps for the reason that their dense, spreading tops shut out the\r\n",
      "light. As I saw afterwards both trunks and boughs were clothed with\r\n",
      "long grey moss, which even at midday gave the place a very ghostly\r\n",
      "appearance. The darkness beneath those trees was intense, literally we\r\n",
      "could not see an inch before our faces. Yet rather than stand still we\r\n",
      "struggled on, Hans leading the way, for his instincts were quicker than\r\n",
      "ours. The steep rise of the ground beneath our feet told us that we\r\n",
      "were going uphill, as we wished to do, and from time to time I\r\n",
      "consulted a pocket compass I carried by the light of a match, knowing\r\n",
      "from previous observations that the top of the Holy Mount lay due\r\n",
      "north.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus for hour after hour we crept up and on, occasionally butting into\r\n",
      "the trunk of a tree or stumbling over a fallen bough, but meeting with\r\n",
      "no other adventures or obstacles of a physical kind. Of moral, or\r\n",
      "rather mental, obstacles there were many, since to all of us the\r\n",
      "atmosphere of this forest was as that of a haunted house. It may have\r\n",
      "been the embracing darkness, or the sough of the night wind amongst the\r\n",
      "boughs and mosses, or the sense of the imminent dangers that we had\r\n",
      "passed and that still awaited us. Or it may have been unknown horrors\r\n",
      "connected with this place of which some spiritual essence still\r\n",
      "survived, for without doubt localities preserve such influences, which\r\n",
      "can be felt by the sensitive among living things, especially in\r\n",
      "favouring conditions of fear and gloom. At any rate I never experienced\r\n",
      "more subtle and yet more penetrating terrors than I did upon that\r\n",
      "night, and afterwards Ragnall confessed to me that my case was his own.\r\n",
      "Black as it was I thought that I saw apparitions, among them glaring\r\n",
      "eyes and that of the elephant Jana standing in front of me with his\r\n",
      "trunk raised against the bole of a cedar. I could have sworn that I saw\r\n",
      "him, nor was I reassured when Hans whispered to me below his breath,\r\n",
      "for here we did not seem to dare to raise our voices:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âLook, Baas. Is it Jana glowing like hot iron who stands yonder?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âDonât be a fool,â I answered. âHow can Jana be here and, if he were\r\n",
      "here, how could we see him in the night?â But as I said the words I\r\n",
      "remembered HarÃ»t had told us that Jana had been met with on the Holy\r\n",
      "Mount âin the spirit or in the flesh.â However this may be, next\r\n",
      "instant he was gone and we beheld him or his shadow no more. Also we\r\n",
      "thought that from time to time we heard voices speaking all around us,\r\n",
      "now here, now there and now in the tree tops above our heads, though\r\n",
      "what they said we could not catch or understand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus the long night wore away. Our progress was very slow, but guided\r\n",
      "by occasional glimpses at the compass we never stopped but twice, once\r\n",
      "when we found ourselves apparently surrounded by tree boles and fallen\r\n",
      "boughs, and once when we got into swampy ground. Then we took the risk\r\n",
      "of lighting the lantern, and by its aid picked our way through these\r\n",
      "difficult places. By degrees the trees grew fewer so that we could see\r\n",
      "the stars between their tops. This was a help to us as I knew that one\r\n",
      "of them, which I had carefully noted, shone at this season of the year\r\n",
      "directly over the cone of the mountain, and we were enabled to steer\r\n",
      "thereby.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It must have been not more than half an hour before the dawn that Hans,\r\n",
      "who was leadingâwe were pushing our way through thick bushes at the\r\n",
      "timeâhalted hurriedly, saying:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âStop, Baas, we are on the edge of a cliff. When I thrust my stick\r\n",
      "forward it stands on nothing.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Needless to say we pulled up dead and so remained without stirring an\r\n",
      "inch, for who could say what might be beyond us? Ragnall wished to\r\n",
      "examine the ground with the lantern. I was about to consent, though\r\n",
      "doubtfully, when suddenly I heard voices murmuring and through the\r\n",
      "screen of bushes saw lights moving at a little distance, forty feet or\r\n",
      "more below us. Then we gave up all idea of making further use of the\r\n",
      "lantern and crouched still as mice in our bushes, waiting for the dawn.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It came at last. In the east appeared a faint pearly flush that by\r\n",
      "degrees spread itself over the whole arch of the sky and was welcomed\r\n",
      "by the barking of monkeys and the call of birds in the depths of the\r\n",
      "dew-steeped forest. Next a ray from the unrisen sun, a single spear of\r\n",
      "light shot suddenly across the sky, and as it appeared, from the\r\n",
      "darkness below us arose a sound of chanting, very low and sweet to\r\n",
      "hear. It died away and for a little while there was silence broken only\r\n",
      "by a rustling sound like to that of people taking their seats in a dark\r\n",
      "theatre. Then a woman began to sing in a beautiful, contralto voice,\r\n",
      "but in what language I do not know, for I could not catch the words, if\r\n",
      "these were words and not only musical notes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I felt Ragnall trembling beside me and in a whisper asked him what was\r\n",
      "the matter. He answered, also in a whisper:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI believe that is my wifeâs voice.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIf so, I beg you to control yourself,â I replied.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now the skies began to flame and the light to pour itself into a misty\r\n",
      "hollow beneath us like streams of many-coloured gems into a bowl,\r\n",
      "driving away the shadows. By degrees these vanished; by degrees we saw\r\n",
      "everything. Beneath us was an amphitheatre, on the southern wall of\r\n",
      "which we were seated, though it was not a wall but a lava cliff between\r\n",
      "forty and fifty feet high which served as a wall. The amphitheatre\r\n",
      "itself, however, almost exactly resembled those of the ancients which I\r\n",
      "had seen in pictures and Ragnall had visited in Italy, Greece, and\r\n",
      "Southern France. It was oval in shape and not very large, perhaps the\r\n",
      "flat space at the bottom may have covered something over an acre, but\r\n",
      "all round this oval ran tiers of seats cut in the lava of the crater.\r\n",
      "For without doubt this was the crater of an extinct volcano.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Moreover, in what I will call the arena, stood a temple that in its\r\n",
      "main outlines, although small, exactly resembled those still to be seen\r\n",
      "in Egypt. There was the gateway or pylon; there the open outer court\r\n",
      "with columns round it supporting roofed cloisters, which, as we\r\n",
      "ascertained afterwards, were used as dwelling-places by the priests.\r\n",
      "There beyond and connected with the first by a short passage was a\r\n",
      "second rather smaller court, also open to the sky, and beyond this\r\n",
      "again, built like all the rest of the temple of lava blocks, a roofed\r\n",
      "erection measuring about twelve feet square, which I guessed at once\r\n",
      "must be the sanctuary.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This temple was, as I have said, small, but extremely well\r\n",
      "proportioned, every detail of it being in the most excellent taste\r\n",
      "though unornamented by sculpture or painting. I have to add that in\r\n",
      "front of the sanctuary door stood a large block of lava, which I\r\n",
      "concluded was an altar, and in front of this a stone seat and a basin,\r\n",
      "also of stone, supported upon a very low tripod. Further, behind the\r\n",
      "sanctuary was a square house with window-places.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At the moment of our first sight of this place the courts were empty,\r\n",
      "but on the benches of the amphitheatre were seated about three hundred\r\n",
      "persons, male and female, the men to the north and the women to the\r\n",
      "south. They were all clad in pure white robes, the heads of the men\r\n",
      "being shaved and those of the women veiled, but leaving the face\r\n",
      "exposed. Lastly, there were two roadways into the amphitheatre, one\r\n",
      "running east and one west through tunnels hollowed in the encircling\r\n",
      "rock of the crater, both of which roads were closed at the mouths of\r\n",
      "the tunnels by massive wooden double doors, seventeen or eighteen feet\r\n",
      "in height. From these roadways and their doors we learned two things.\r\n",
      "First, that the cave where had lived the Father of Serpents was, as I\r\n",
      "had suspected, not the real approach to the shrine of the Child, but\r\n",
      "only a blind; and, secondly, that the ceremony we were about to witness\r\n",
      "was secret and might only be attended by the priestly class or families\r\n",
      "of this strange tribe.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Scarcely was it full daylight when from the cells of the cloisters\r\n",
      "round the outer court issued twelve priests headed by HarÃ»t himself,\r\n",
      "who looked very dignified in his white garment, each of whom carried on\r\n",
      "a wooden platter ears of different kinds of corn. Then from the cells\r\n",
      "of the southern cloister issued twelve women, or rather girls, for all\r\n",
      "were young and very comely, who ranged themselves alongside of the men.\r\n",
      "These also carried wooden platters, and on them blooming flowers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At a sign they struck up a religious chant and began to walk forward\r\n",
      "through the passage that led from the first court to the second.\r\n",
      "Arriving in front of the altar they halted and one by one, first a\r\n",
      "priest and then a priestess, set down the platters of offerings, piling\r\n",
      "them above each other into a cone. Next the priests and the priestesses\r\n",
      "ranged themselves in lines on either side of the altar, and HarÃ»t took\r\n",
      "a platter of corn and a platter of flowers in his hands. These he held\r\n",
      "first towards that quarter of the sky in which swam the invisible new\r\n",
      "moon, secondly towards the rising sun, and thirdly towards the doors of\r\n",
      "the sanctuary, making genuflexions and uttering some chanted prayer,\r\n",

      "themselves on either side. Next HarÃ»t, having once more opened the door\r\n",
      "of the sanctuary, took his stand a little to the right of it and\r\n",

      "the only one of them who understood a word of English, retiring behind\r\n",

      "the name of our own God. Being a liberal-minded man who had travelled,\r\n",
      "HarÃ»t gave way on the point. So I swore first to the effect that I\r\n",
      "would fight for the White Kendah to the finish in consideration of the\r\n",
      "promises that they had made to us. I added that I would not attempt\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "repeating the words after me and finishing on his own account with âso\r\n",
      "help me the reverend Predikant, the Baasâs father,â a form that he\r\n",
      "utterly declined to vary although it involved more explanations. When\r\n",

      "the priests that to his mind my poor father stood in exactly the same\r\n",
      "relation to the Power above us as their Oracle did to the Child. He\r\n",
      "offered generously, however, to throw in the spirits of his grandfather\r\n",

      "better of his neighbour in his masterâs service, honestly if possible;\r\n",
      "if not, by any means that came to his hand down to that of murder. At\r\n",

      "god, named Love, not of woman or child, but of my humble self. His\r\n",
      "principles were those of a rather sly but very high-class and exclusive\r\n",
      "dog, neither better nor worse. Still, when all is said and done, there\r\n",
      "are lower creatures in the world than high-class dogs. At least so the\r\n",

      "The ceremonies were over and the priests, with the exception of HarÃ»t\r\n",
      "and two who remained to attend upon him, vanished, probably to inform\r\n",
      "the male and female hierophants of their result, and through these the\r\n",
      "whole people of the White Kendah. Old HarÃ»t stared at us for a little\r\n",
      "while, then said in English, which he always liked to talk when Ragnall\r\n",
      "was present, perhaps for the sake of practice:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhat you like do now, eh? Pârâaps wish fly back to Town of Child, for\r\n",
      "suppose this how you come. If so, please take me with you, because that\r\n",
      "save long ride.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âOh! no,â I answered. âWe walked here through that hole where lived the\r\n",
      "Father of Snakes who died of fear when he saw us, and just mixed with\r\n",
      "the rest of you in the court of the temple.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âGood lie,â said HarÃ»t admiringly, âvery first-class lie! Wonder how\r\n",
      "you kill great snake, which we all think never die, for he live there\r\n",
      "hundred, hundred years; our people find him there when first they come\r\n",
      "to this country, and make him kind of god. Well, he nasty beast and\r\n",
      "best dead. I say, you like see Child? If so, come, for you our brothers\r\n",
      "now, only please take off hat and not speak.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I intimated that we should âlike see Child,â and led by HarÃ»t we\r\n",
      "entered the little sanctuary which was barely large enough to hold all\r\n",
      "of us. In a niche of the end wall stood the sacred effigy which Ragnall\r\n",
      "and I examined with a kind of reverent interest. It proved to be the\r\n",
      "statue of an infant about two feet high, cut, I imagine, from the base\r\n",
      "of a single but very large elephantâs tusk, so ancient that the\r\n",
      "yellowish ivory had become rotten and was covered with a multitude of\r\n",
      "tiny fissures. Indeed, for its appearance I made up my mind that\r\n",
      "several thousands of years must have passed since the beast died from\r\n",
      "which this ivory was taken, especially as it had, I presume, always\r\n",
      "been carefully preserved under cover.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The workmanship of the object was excellent, that of a fine artist who,\r\n",
      "I should think, had taken some living infant for his model, perhaps a\r\n",
      "child of the Pharaoh of the day. Here I may say at once that there\r\n",
      "could be no doubt of its Egyptian origin, since on one side of the head\r\n",
      "was a single lock of hair, while the fourth finger of the right hand\r\n",
      "was held before the lips as though to enjoin silence. Both of these\r\n",
      "peculiarities, it will be remembered, are characteristic of the infant\r\n",
      "Horus, the child of Osiris and Isis, as portrayed in bronzes and temple\r\n",
      "carvings. So at least Ragnall, who recently had studied many such\r\n",
      "effigies in Egypt, informed me later. There was nothing else in the\r\n",
      "place except an ancient, string-seated chair of ebony, adorned with\r\n",
      "inlaid ivory patterns; an effigy of a snake in porcelain, showing that\r\n",
      "serpent worship was in some way mixed up with their religion; and two\r\n",
      "rolls of papyrus, at least that is what they looked like, which were\r\n",
      "laid in the niche with the statue. These rolls, to my disappointment,\r\n",
      "HarÃ»t refused to allow us to examine or even to touch.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After we had left the sanctuary I asked HarÃ»t when this figure was\r\n",
      "brought to their land. He replied that it came when they came, at what\r\n",
      "date he could not tell us as it was so long ago, and that with it came\r\n",
      "the worship and the ceremonies of their religion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In answer to further questions he added that this figure, which seemed\r\n",
      "to be of ivory, contained the spirits which ruled the sun and the moon,\r\n",
      "and through them the world. This, said Ragnall, was just a piece of\r\n",
      "Egyptian theology, preserved down to our own times in a remote corner\r\n",
      "of Africa, doubtless by descendants of dwellers on the Nile who had\r\n",
      "been driven thence in some national catastrophe, and brought away with\r\n",
      "them their faith and one of the effigies of their gods. Perhaps they\r\n",
      "fled at the time of the Persian invasion by Cambyses.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After we had emerged from this deeply interesting shrine, which was\r\n",
      "locked behind us, HarÃ»t led us, not through the passage connecting it\r\n",
      "with the stone house that we knew was occupied by Ragnallâs wife in her\r\n",
      "capacity as Guardian of the Child, or a latter-day personification of\r\n",
      "Isis, Lady of the Moon, at which house he cast many longing glances,\r\n",
      "but back through the two courts and the pylon to the gateway of the\r\n",
      "temple. Here on the road by which we had entered the place, a fact\r\n",
      "which we did not mention to him, he paused and addressed us.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âLords,â he said, ânow you and the People of the White Kendah are one;\r\n",
      "your ends are their ends, your fate is their fate, their secrets are\r\n",
      "your secrets. You, Lord Igeza, work for a reward, namely the person of\r\n",
      "that lady whom we took from you on the Nile.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âHow did you do that?â interrupted Ragnall when I had interpreted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âLord, we watched you. We knew when you came to Egypt; we followed you\r\n",
      "in Egypt, whither we had journeyed on our road to England once more to\r\n",
      "seek our Oracles, till the day of our opportunity dawned. Then at night\r\n",
      "we called her and she obeyed the call, as she must do whose mind we\r\n",
      "have taken awayâask me not howâand brought her to dwell with us, she\r\n",
      "who is marked from her birth with the holy sign and wears upon her\r\n",
      "breast certain charmed stones and a symbol that for thousands of years\r\n",
      "have adorned the body of the Child and those of its Oracles. Do you\r\n",
      "remember a company of Arabs whom you saw riding on the banks of the\r\n",
      "Great River on the day before the night when she was lost to you? We\r\n",
      "were with that company and on our camels we bore her thence, happy and\r\n",
      "unharmed to this our land, as I trust, when all is done, we shall bear\r\n",
      "her back again and you with her.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI trust so also, for you have wrought me a great wrong,â said Ragnall\r\n",
      "briefly, âperhaps a greater wrong than I know at present, for how came\r\n",
      "it that my boy was killed by an elephant?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAsk that question of Jana and not of me,â HarÃ»t answered darkly. Then\r\n",
      "he went on: âYou also, Lord Macumazana, work for a reward, the\r\n",
      "countless store of ivory which your eyes have beheld lying in the\r\n",
      "burial place of elephants beyond the Tava River. When you have slain\r\n",
      "Jana who watches the store, and defeated the Black Kendah who serve\r\n",
      "him, it is yours and we will give you camels to bear it, or some of it,\r\n",
      "for all cannot be carried, to the sea where it can be taken away in\r\n",
      "ships. As for the yellow man, I think that he seeks no reward who soon\r\n",
      "will inherit all things.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThe old witch-doctor means that I am going to die,â remarked Hans\r\n",
      "expectorating reflectively. âWell, Baas, I am quite ready, if only Jana\r\n",
      "and certain others die first. Indeed I grow too old to fight and travel\r\n",
      "as I used to do, and therefore shall be glad to pass to some land where\r\n",
      "I become young again.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âStuff and rubbish!â I exclaimed, then turned and listened to HarÃ»t\r\n",
      "who, not understanding our Dutch conversation, was speaking once more.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âLords,â he said, âthese paths which run east and west are the real\r\n",
      "approach to the mountain top and the temple, not that which, as I\r\n",
      "suppose, led you through the cave of the old serpent. The road to the\r\n",
      "west, which wanders round the base of the hill to a pass in those\r\n",
      "distant mountains and thence across the deserts to the north, is so\r\n",
      "easy to stop that by it we need fear no attack. With this eastern road\r\n",
      "the case is, however, different, as I shall now show you, if you will\r\n",
      "ride with me.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then he gave some orders to two attendant priests who departed at a run\r\n",
      "and presently reappeared at the head of a small train of camels which\r\n",
      "had been hidden, I know not where. We mounted and, following the road\r\n",
      "across a flat piece of ground, found that not more than half a mile\r\n",
      "away was another precipitous ridge of rock which had presumably once\r\n",
      "formed the lip of an outer crater. This ridge, however, was broken away\r\n",
      "for a width of two or three hundred yards, perhaps by some outrush of\r\n",
      "lava, the road running through the centre of the gap on which schanzes\r\n",
      "had been built here and there for purposes of defence. Looking at these\r\n",
      "I saw that they were very old and inefficient and asked when they had\r\n",
      "been erected. HarÃ»t replied about a century before when the last war\r\n",
      "took place with the Black Kendah, who had been finally driven off at\r\n",
      "this spot, for then the White Kendah were more numerous than at\r\n",
      "present.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âSo Simba knows this road?â I said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYes, Lord, and Jana knows it also, for he fought in that war and still\r\n",
      "at times visits us here and kills any whom he may meet. Only to the\r\n",
      "temple he has never dared to come.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now I wondered whether we had really seen Jana in the forest on the\r\n",
      "previous night, but coming to the conclusion that it was useless to\r\n",
      "investigate the matter, made no inquiries, especially as these would\r\n",
      "have revealed to HarÃ»t the route by which we approached the temple.\r\n",
      "Only I pointed out to him that proper defences should be put up here\r\n",
      "without delay, that is if they meant to make a stronghold of the\r\n",

      "that, notwithstanding the state of mental excitement into which the\r\n",

      "the White Kendah bartered produce. Here we found HarÃ»t and about twenty\r\n",
      "of the headmen seated in the shade of a thatched roof, while behind\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Presently they came, five of them, great, truculent-looking fellows of\r\n",

      "their weapons into the town, but adorned with the usual silver chains\r\n",
      "across their breasts to show their rank, and other savage finery. In\r\n",
      "the man who was their leader I recognized one of those messengers who\r\n",
      "had accosted us when first we entered their territory on our way from\r\n",
      "the south, before that fight in which I was taken prisoner. Stepping\r\n",
      "forward and addressing himself to HarÃ»t, he said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âA while ago, O Prophet of the Child, I, the messenger of the god Jana,\r\n",
      "speaking through the mouth of Simba the King, gave to you and your\r\n",
      "brother MarÃ»t a certain warning to which you did not listen. Now Jana\r\n",
      "has MarÃ»t, and again I come to warn you, HarÃ»t.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIf I remember right,â interrupted HarÃ»t blandly, âI think that on that\r\n",
      "occasion two of you delivered the message and that the Child marked one\r\n",
      "of you upon the brow. If Jana has my brother, say, where is yours?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWe warned you,â went on the messenger, âand you cursed us in the name\r\n",
      "of the Child.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYes,â interrupted HarÃ»t again, âwe cursed you with three curses. The\r\n",
      "first was the curse of Heaven by storm or drought, which has fallen\r\n",
      "upon you. The second was the curse of famine, which is falling upon\r\n",
      "you; and the third was the curse of war, which is yet to fall on you.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIt is of war that we come to speak,â replied the messenger,\r\n",
      "diplomatically avoiding the other two topics which perhaps he found it\r\n",
      "awkward to discuss.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThat is foolish of you,â replied the bland HarÃ»t, âseeing that the\r\n",
      "other day you matched yourselves against us with but small success.\r\n",
      "Many of you were killed but only a very few of us, and the white lord\r\n",
      "whom you took captive escaped out of your hands and from the tusks of\r\n",
      "Jana who, I think, now lacks an eye. If he is a god, how comes it that\r\n",
      "he lacks an eye and could not kill an unarmed white man?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âLet Jana answer for himself, as he will do ere long, O HarÃ»t.\r\n",
      "Meanwhile, these are the words of Jana spoken through the mouth of\r\n",
      "Simba the King: The Child has destroyed my harvest and therefore I\r\n",
      "demand this of the people of the Childâthat they give me three-fourths\r\n",
      "of their harvest, reaping the same and delivering it on the south bank\r\n",
      "of the River Tava. That they give me the two white lords to be\r\n",
      "sacrificed to me. That they give the white lady who is Guardian of the\r\n",
      "Child to be a wife of Simba the King, and with her a hundred virgins of\r\n",
      "your people. That the image of the Child be brought to the god Jana in\r\n",
      "the presence of his priests and Simba the King. These are the demands\r\n",
      "of Jana spoken through the mouth of Simba the King.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Watching, I saw a thrill of horror shake the forms of HarÃ»t and of all\r\n",
      "those with him as the full meaning of these, to them, most impious\r\n",
      "requests sank into their minds. But he only asked very quietly:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAnd if we refuse the demands, what then?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThen,â shouted the messenger insolently, âthen Jana declares war upon\r\n",
      "you, the last war of all, war till every one of your men be dead and\r\n",
      "the Child you worship is burnt to grey ashes with fire. War till your\r\n",
      "women are taken as slaves and the corn which you refuse is stored in\r\n",
      "our grain pits and your land is a waste and your name forgotten.\r\n",
      "Already the hosts of Jana are gathered and the trumpet of Jana calls\r\n",
      "them to the fight. To-morrow or the next day they advance upon you, and\r\n",
      "ere the moon is full not one of you will be left to look upon her.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "HarÃ»t rose, and walking from under the shed, turned his back upon the\r\n",
      "envoys and stared at the distant line of great mountains which stood\r\n",
      "out far away against the sky. Out of curiosity I followed him and\r\n",
      "observed that these mountains were no longer visible. Where they had\r\n",
      "been was nothing but a line of black and heavy cloud. After looking for\r\n",
      "a while he returned and addressing the envoys, said quite casually:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIf you will be advised by me, friends, you will ride hard for the\r\n",
      "river. There is such rain upon the mountains as I have never seen\r\n",
      "before, and you will be fortunate if you cross it before the flood\r\n",
      "comes down, the greatest flood that has happened in our day.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This intelligence seemed to disturb the messengers, for they too\r\n",
      "stepped out of the shed and stared at the mountains, muttering to each\r\n",
      "other something that I could not understand. Then they returned and\r\n",
      "with a fine appearance of indifference demanded an immediate answer to\r\n",
      "their challenge.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âCan you not guess it?â answered HarÃ»t. Then changing his tone he drew\r\n",
      "himself to his full height and thundered out at them: âGet you back to\r\n",
      "your evil spirit of a god that hides in the shape of a beast of the\r\n",
      "forest and to his slave who calls himself a king, and say to them:\r\n",
      "âThus speaks the Child to his rebellious servants, the Black Kendah\r\n",
      "dogs: Swim my river when you can, which will not be yet, and come up\r\n",
      "against me when you will; for whenever you come I shall be ready for\r\n",
      "you. You are already dead, O Jana. You are already dead, O Simba the\r\n",
      "slave. You are scattered and lost, O dogs of the Black Kendah, and the\r\n",
      "home of such of you as remain shall be far away in a barren land, where\r\n",
      "you must dig deep for water and live upon the wild game because there\r\n",
      "little corn will grow.â Now begone, and swiftly, lest you stop here for\r\n",
      "ever.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So they turned and went, leaving me full of admiration for the\r\n",
      "histrionic powers of HarÃ»t.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I must add, however, that being without doubt a keen observer of the\r\n",
      "weather conditions of the neighbourhood, he was quite right about the\r\n",
      "rain upon the mountains, which by the way never extended to the\r\n",
      "territory of the People of the Child. As we heard afterwards, the flood\r\n",
      "came down just as the envoys reached the river; indeed, one of them was\r\n",
      "drowned in attempting its crossing, and for fourteen days after this it\r\n",
      "remained impassable to an army.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That very evening we began our preparations to meet an attack which was\r\n",
      "now inevitable. Putting aside the supposed rival powers of the tribal\r\n",
      "divinities worshipped under the names of the Child and Jana, which,\r\n",
      "while they added a kind of Homeric interest to the contest, could, we\r\n",
      "felt, scarcely affect an issue that must be decided with cold steel and\r\n",
      "other mortal weapons, the position of the White Kendah was serious\r\n",
      "indeed. As I think I have said, in all they did not number more than\r\n",
      "about two thousand men between the ages of twenty and fifty-five, or,\r\n",
      "including lads between fourteen and twenty and old men still\r\n",
      "able-bodied between fifty-five and seventy, say two thousand seven\r\n",
      "hundred capable of some sort of martial service. To these might be\r\n",
      "added something under two thousand women, since among this dwindling\r\n",
      "folk, oddly enough, from causes that I never ascertained, the males\r\n",
      "out-numbered the females, which accounted for their marriage customs\r\n",
      "that were, by comparison with those of most African peoples,\r\n",
      "monogamous. At any rate only the rich among them had more than one\r\n",
      "wife, while the poor or otherwise ineligible often had none at all,\r\n",
      "since inter-marriage with other races and above all with the Black\r\n",
      "Kendah dwelling beyond the river was so strictly taboo that it was\r\n",
      "punishable with death or expulsion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Against this little band the Black Kendah could bring up twenty\r\n",
      "thousand men, besides boys and aged persons who with the women would\r\n",
      "probably be left to defend their own country, that is, not less than\r\n",
      "ten to one. Moreover, all of these enemies would be fighting with the\r\n",
      "courage of despair, since quite three-fourths of their crops with many\r\n",
      "of their cattle and sheep had been destroyed by the terrific hail-burst\r\n",
      "that I have described. Therefore, since no other corn was available in\r\n",
      "the surrounding land, where they dwelt alone encircled by deserts,\r\n",
      "either they must capture that of the White Kendah, or suffer terribly\r\n",
      "from starvation until a year later when another harvest ripened.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The only points I could see in favour of the People of the Child were\r\n",
      "that they would fight on the vantage ground of their mountain\r\n",
      "stronghold, a formidable position if properly defended. Also they would\r\n",
      "have the benefit of the skill and knowledge of Ragnall and myself.\r\n",
      "Lastly, the enemy must face our rifles. Neither the White nor the Black\r\n",
      "Kendah, I should say, possessed any guns, except a few antiquated\r\n",
      "flintlock weapons that the former had captured from some nomadic tribe\r\n",
      "and kept as curiosities. Why this was the case I do not know, since\r\n",
      "undoubtedly at times the White Kendah traded in camels and corn with\r\n",
      "Arabs who wandered as far as the Sudan, or Egypt, nomadic tribes to\r\n",
      "whom even then firearms were known, although perhaps rarely used by\r\n",
      "them. But so it was, possibly because of some old law or prejudice\r\n",
      "which forbade their introduction into the country, or mayhap of the\r\n",
      "difficulty of procuring powder and lead, or for the reason that they\r\n",
      "had none to teach them the use of such new-fangled weapons.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now it will be remembered that, on the chance of their proving useful,\r\n",
      "Ragnall, in addition to our own sporting rifles, had brought with him\r\n",
      "to Africa fifty Snider rifles with an ample supply of ammunition, the\r\n",
      "same that I had trouble in passing through the Customs at Durban, all\r\n",
      "of which had arrived safely at the Town of the Child. Clearly our first\r\n",
      "duty was to make the best possible use of this invaluable store. To\r\n",
      "that end I asked HarÃ»t to select seventy-five of the boldest and most\r\n",
      "intelligent young men among his people, and to hand them over to me and\r\n",
      "Hans for instruction in musketry. We had only fifty rifles but I\r\n",
      "drilled seventy-five men, or fifty per cent. more, that some might be\r\n",
      "ready to replace any who fell.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "From dawn to dark each day Hans and I worked at trying to convert these\r\n",
      "Kendah into sharpshooters. It was no easy task with men, however\r\n",
      "willing, who till then had never held a gun, especially as I must be\r\n",
      "very sparing of the ammunition necessary to practice, of which of\r\n",
      "course our supply was limited. Still we taught them how to take cover,\r\n",
      "how to fire and to cease from firing at a word of command, also to hold\r\n",
      "the rifles low and waste no shot. To make marksmen of them was more\r\n",
      "than I could hope to do under the circumstances.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With the exception of these men nearly the entire male population were\r\n",
      "working day and night to get in the harvest. This proved a very\r\n",
      "difficult business, both because some of the crops were scarcely fit\r\n",
      "and because all the grain had to be carried on camels to be stored in\r\n",
      "and at the back of the second court of the temple, the only place where\r\n",
      "it was likely to be safe. Indeed in the end a great deal was left\r\n",
      "unreaped. Then the herds of cattle and breeding camels which grazed on\r\n",
      "the farther sides of the Holy Mount must be brought into places of\r\n",
      "safety, glens in the forest on its slope, and forage stacked to feed\r\n",
      "them. Also it was necessary to provide scouts to keep watch along the\r\n",
      "river.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lastly, the fortifications in the mountain pass required unceasing\r\n",
      "labour and attention. This was the task of Ragnall, who fortunately in\r\n",
      "his youth, before he succeeded unexpectedly to the title, was for some\r\n",
      "years an officer in the Royal Engineers and therefore thoroughly\r\n",
      "understood that business. Indeed he understood it rather too well,\r\n",
      "since the result of his somewhat complicated and scientific scheme of\r\n",
      "defence was a little confusing to the simple native mind. However, with\r\n",
      "the assistance of all the priests and of all the women and children who\r\n",
      "were not engaged in provisioning the Mount, he built wall after wall\r\n",
      "and redoubt after redoubt, if that is the right word, to say nothing of\r\n",
      "the shelter trenches he dug and many pitfalls, furnished at the bottom\r\n",
      "with sharp stakes, which he hollowed out wherever the soil could be\r\n",
      "easily moved, to discomfit a charging enemy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Indeed, when I saw the amount of work he had concluded in ten days,\r\n",
      "which was not until I joined him on the mountain, I was quite\r\n",
      "astonished.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "About this time a dispute arose as to whether we should attempt to\r\n",
      "prevent the Black Kendah from crossing the river which was now running\r\n",
      "down, a plan that some of the elders favoured. At last the controversy\r\n",
      "was referred to me as head general and I decided against anything of\r\n",
      "the sort. It seemed to me that our force was too small, and that if I\r\n",
      "took the rifle-men a great deal of ammunition might be expended with\r\n",
      "poor result. Also in the event of any reverse or when we were finally\r\n",
      "driven back, which must happen, there might be difficulty about\r\n",
      "remounting the camels, our only means of escape from the horsemen who\r\n",
      "would possibly gallop us down. Moreover the Tava had several fords, any\r\n",
      "one of which might be selected by the enemy. So it was arranged that we\r\n",
      "should make our first and last stand upon the Holy Mount.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On the fourteenth night from new moon our swift camel-scouts who were\r\n",
      "posted in relays between the Tava and the Mount reported that the Black\r\n",
      "Kendah were gathered in thousands upon the farther side of the river,\r\n",
      "where they were engaged in celebrating magical ceremonies. On the\r\n",
      "fifteenth night the scouts reported that they were crossing the river,\r\n",
      "about five thousand horsemen and fifteen thousand foot soldiers, and\r\n",
      "that at the head of them marched the huge god-elephant Jana, on which\r\n",
      "rode Simba the King and a lame priest (evidently my friend whose foot\r\n",
      "had been injured by the pistol), who acted as a mahout. This part of\r\n",
      "the story I confess I did not believe, since it seemed to me impossible\r\n",
      "that anyone could ride upon that mad rogue, Jana. Yet, as subsequent\r\n",
      "events showed, it was in fact true. I suppose that in certain hands the\r\n",
      "beast became tame. Or perhaps it was drugged.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Two nights later, for the Black Kendah advanced but slowly, spreading\r\n",
      "themselves over the country in order to collect such crops as had not\r\n",
      "been gathered through lack of time or because they were still unripe,\r\n",
      "we saw flames and smoke arising from the Town of the Child beneath us,\r\n",
      "which they had fired. Now we knew that the time of trial had come and\r\n",
      "until near midnight men, women and children worked feverishly finishing\r\n",
      "or trying to finish the fortifications and making every preparation in\r\n",
      "our power.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Our position was that we held a very strong post, that is, strong\r\n",
      "against an enemy unprovided with big guns or even firearms, which, as\r\n",
      "all other possible approaches had been blocked, was only assailable by\r\n",
      "direct frontal attack from the east. In the pass we had three main\r\n",
      "lines of defence, one arranged behind the other and separated by\r\n",
      "distances of a few hundred yards. Our last refuge was furnished by the\r\n",
      "walls of the temple itself, in the rear of which were camped the whole\r\n",
      "White Kendah tribe, save a few hundred who were employed in watching\r\n",
      "the herds of camels and stock in almost inaccessible positions on the\r\n",
      "northern slopes of the Mount.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There were perhaps five thousand people of both sexes and every age\r\n",
      "gathered in this camp, which was so well provided with food and water\r\n",
      "that it could have stood a siege of several months. If, however, our\r\n",
      "defences should be carried there was no possibility of escape, since we\r\n",
      "learned from our scouts that the Black Kendah, who by tradition and\r\n",
      "through spies were well acquainted with every feature of the country,\r\n",
      "had detached a party of several thousand men to watch the western road\r\n",

      "arrived about some business, I forget what, sent by Ragnall I think,\r\n",
      "who had risen before I woke. I turned to give the pannikin to Hans, but\r\n",
      "he had vanished in his snake-like fashion, so I threw it down upon the\r\n",
      "ground and devoted my mind to the question raised in Ragnallâs message.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Next minute scouts came in who had been watching the camp of the Black\r\n",
      "Kendah all night.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "These were sleeping not more than half a mile away, in an open place on\r\n",
      "the slope of the hill with pickets thrown out round them, intending to\r\n",
      "advance upon us, it was said, as soon as the sun rose, since because of\r\n",
      "their number they feared lest to march at night should throw them into\r\n",
      "confusion and, in case of their falling into an ambush, bring about a\r\n",
      "disaster. Such at least was the story of two spies whom our people had\r\n",
      "captured.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There had been some question as to whether we should not attempt a\r\n",
      "night attack upon their camp, of which I was rather in favour. After\r\n",
      "full debate, however, the idea had been abandoned, owing to the fewness\r\n",
      "of our numbers, the dislike which the White Kendah shared with the\r\n",
      "Black of attempting to operate in the dark, and the well chosen\r\n",
      "position of our enemy, whom it would be impossible to rush before we\r\n",
      "were discovered by their outposts. What I hoped in my heart was that\r\n",
      "they might try to rush us, notwithstanding the story of the two\r\n",
      "captured spies, and in the gloom, after the moon had sunk low and\r\n",
      "before the dawn came, become entangled in our pitfalls and outlying\r\n",
      "entrenchments, where we should be able to destroy a great number of\r\n",
      "them. Only on the previous afternoon that cunning old fellow, Hans, had\r\n",
      "pointed out to me how advantageous such an event would be to our cause\r\n",
      "and, while agreeing with him, I suggested that probably the Black\r\n",
      "Kendah knew this as well as we did, as the prisoners had told us.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yet that very thing happened, and through Hans himself. Thus: Old HarÃ»t\r\n",
      "had come to me just one hour before the dawn to inform me that all our\r\n",
      "people were awake and at their stations, and to make some last\r\n",
      "arrangements as to the course of the defence, also about our final\r\n",
      "concentration behind the last line of walls and in the first court of\r\n",
      "the temple, if we should be driven from the outer entrenchments. He was\r\n",
      "telling me that the Oracle of the Child had uttered words at the\r\n",
      "ceremony that night which he and all the priests considered were of the\r\n",
      "most favourable import, news to which I listened with some impatience,\r\n",
      "feeling as I did that this business had passed out of the range of the\r\n",
      "Child and its Oracle. As he spoke, suddenly through the silence that\r\n",
      "precedes the dawn, there floated to our ears the unmistakable sound of\r\n",
      "a rifle. Yes, a rifle shot, half a mile or so away, followed by the\r\n",
      "roaring murmur of a great camp unexpectedly alarmed at night.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWho can have fired that?â I asked. âThe Black Kendah have no guns.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He replied that he did not know, unless some of my fifty men had left\r\n",
      "their posts.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While we were investigating the matter, scouts rushed in with the\r\n",
      "intelligence that the Black Kendah, thinking apparently that they were\r\n",
      "being attacked, had broken camp and were advancing towards us. We\r\n",
      "passed a warning all down the lines and stood to arms. Five minutes\r\n",
      "later, as I stood listening to that approaching roar, filled with every\r\n",
      "kind of fear and melancholy foreboding such as the hour and the\r\n",
      "occasion might well have evoked, through the gloom, which was dense,\r\n",
      "the moon being hidden behind the hill, I thought I caught sight of\r\n",
      "something running towards me like a crouching man. I lifted my rifle to\r\n",
      "fire but, reflecting that it might be no more than a hyena and fearing\r\n",
      "to provoke a fusilade from my half-trained company, did not do so.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Next instant I was glad indeed, for immediately on the other side of\r\n",
      "the wall behind which I was standing I heard a well-known voice gasp\r\n",
      "out:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âDonât shoot, Baas, it is I.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhat have you been doing, Hans?â I said as he scrambled over the wall\r\n",
      "to my side, limping a little as I fancied.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âBaas,â he puffed, âI have been paying the Black Kendah a visit. I\r\n",
      "crept down between their stupid outposts, who are as blind in the dark\r\n",
      "as a bat in daytime, hoping to find Jana and put a bullet into his leg\r\n",
      "or trunk. I didnât find him, Baas, although I heard him. But one of\r\n",
      "their captains stood up in front of a watchfire, giving a good shot. My\r\n",
      "bullet found _him_, Baas, for he tumbled back into the fire making the\r\n",
      "sparks fly this way and that. Then I ran and, as you see, got here\r\n",
      "quite safely.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhy did you play that foolâs trick?â I asked, âseeing that it ought to\r\n",
      "have cost you your life?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI shall die just when I have to die, not before, Baas,â he replied in\r\n",
      "the intervals of reloading the little rifle. âAlso it was the trick of\r\n",
      "a wise man, not of a fool, seeing that it has made the Black Kendah\r\n",
      "think that we were attacking them and caused them to hurry on to attack\r\n",
      "_us_ in the dark over ground that they do not know. Listen to them\r\n",
      "coming!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As he spoke a roar of sound told us that the great charge had swept\r\n",
      "round a turn there was in the pass and was heading towards us up the\r\n",
      "straight. Ivory horns brayed, captains shouted orders, the very\r\n",
      "mountains shook beneath the beating of thousands of feet of men and\r\n",
      "horses, while in one great yell that echoed from the cliffs and forests\r\n",
      "went up the battle-cry of â_Jana! Jana!_ââa mixed tumult of noise which\r\n",
      "contrasted very strangely with the utter silence in our ranks.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThey will be among the pitfalls presently,â sniggered Hans, shifting\r\n",
      "his weight nervously from one leg on to the other. âHark! they are\r\n",
      "going into them.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was true. Screams of fear and pain told me that the front ranks had\r\n",
      "begun to fall, horse and foot together, into the cunningly devised\r\n",
      "snares of which with so much labour we had dug many, concealing them\r\n",
      "with earth spread over thin wickerwork, or rather interlaced boughs.\r\n",
      "Into them went the forerunners, to be pierced by the sharp,\r\n",
      "fire-hardened stakes set at the bottom of each pit. Vainly did those\r\n",
      "who were near enough to understand their danger call to the ranks\r\n",
      "behind to stop. They could not or would not comprehend, and had no room\r\n",
      "to extend their front. Forward surged the human torrent, thrusting all\r\n",
      "in front of it to death by wounds or suffocation in those deadly holes,\r\n",
      "till one by one they were filled level with the ground by struggling\r\n",
      "men and horses, over whom the army still rushed on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "How many perished there I do not know, but after the battle was over we\r\n",
      "found scarcely a pit that was not crowded to the brim with dead. Truly\r\n",
      "this device of Ragnallâs, for if I had conceived the idea, which was\r\n",
      "unfamiliar to the Kendah, it was he who had carried it out in so\r\n",
      "masterly a fashion, had served us well.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Still the enemy surged on, since the pits were only large enough to\r\n",
      "hold a tithe of them, till at length, horsemen and footmen mixed up\r\n",
      "together in inextricable confusion, their mighty mass became faintly\r\n",
      "visible quite close to us, a blacker blot upon the gloom.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then my turn came. When they were not more than fifty yards away from\r\n",
      "the first wall, I shouted an order to my riflemen to fire, aiming low,\r\n",
      "and set the example by loosing both barrels of an elephant gun at the\r\n",
      "thickest of the mob. At that distance even the most inexperienced shots\r\n",
      "could not miss such a mark, especially as those bullets that went high\r\n",
      "struck among the oncoming troops behind, or caught the horsemen lifted\r\n",
      "above their fellows. Indeed, of the first few rounds I do not think\r\n",
      "that one was wasted, while often single balls killed or injured several\r\n",
      "men.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The result was instantaneous. The Black Kendah who, be it remembered,\r\n",
      "were totally unaccustomed to the effects of rifle fire and imagined\r\n",
      "that we only possessed two or three guns in all, stopped their advance\r\n",
      "as though paralyzed. For a few seconds there was silence, except for\r\n",
      "the intermittent crackle of the rifles as my men loaded and fired. Next\r\n",
      "came the cries of the smitten men and horses that were falling\r\n",
      "everywhere, and thenâthe unmistakable sound of a stampede.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThey have gone. That was too warm for them, Baas,â chuckled Hans\r\n",
      "exultingly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYes,â I answered, when I had at length succeeded in stopping the\r\n",
      "firing, âbut I expect they will come back with the light. Still, that\r\n",
      "trick of yours has cost them dear, Hans.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By degrees the dawn began to break. It was, I remember, a particularly\r\n",
      "beautiful dawn, resembling a gigantic and vivid rose opening in the\r\n",
      "east, or a cup of brightness from which many coloured wines were poured\r\n",
      "all athwart the firmament. Very peaceful also, for not a breath of wind\r\n",
      "was stirring. But what a scene the first rays of the sun revealed upon\r\n",
      "that narrow stretch of pass in front of us. Everywhere the pitfalls and\r\n",
      "trenches were filled with still surging heaps of men and horses, while\r\n",
      "all about lay dead and wounded men, the red harvest of our rifle fire.\r\n",
      "It was dreadful to contrast the heavenly peace above and the hellish\r\n",
      "horror beneath.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We took count and found that up to this moment we had not lost a single\r\n",
      "man, one only having been slightly wounded by a thrown spear. As is\r\n",
      "common among semi-savages, this fact filled the White Kendah with an\r\n",
      "undue exultation. Thinking that as the beginning was so the end must\r\n",
      "be, they cheered and shouted, shaking each otherâs hands, then fell to\r\n",
      "eating the food which the women brought them with appetite, chattering\r\n",
      "incessantly, although as a general rule they were a very silent people.\r\n",
      "Even the grave HarÃ»t, who arrived full of congratulations, seemed as\r\n",
      "high-spirited as a boy, till I reminded him that the real battle had\r\n",
      "not yet commenced.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Black Kendah had fallen into a trap and lost some of their number,\r\n",
      "that was all, which was fortunate for us but could scarcely affect the\r\n",
      "issue of the struggle, since they had many thousands left. Ragnall, who\r\n",
      "had come up from his lines, agreed with me. As he said, these people\r\n",
      "were fighting for life as well as honour, seeing that most of the corn\r\n",
      "which they needed for their sustenance was stored in great heaps either\r\n",
      "in or to the rear of the temple behind us. Therefore they must come on\r\n",
      "until they won or were destroyed. How with our small force could we\r\n",
      "hope to destroy this multitude? That was the problem which weighed upon\r\n",
      "our hearts.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "About a quarter of an hour later two spies that we had set upon the top\r\n",
      "of the precipitous cliffs, whence they had a good view of the pass\r\n",
      "beyond the bend, came scrambling down the rocks like monkeys by a route\r\n",
      "that was known to them. These boys, for they were no more, reported\r\n",
      "that the Black Kendah were reforming their army beyond the bend of the\r\n",
      "pass, and that the cavalry were dismounting and sending their horses to\r\n",
      "the rear, evidently because they found them useless in such a place. A\r\n",
      "little later solitary men appeared from behind the bend, carrying\r\n",
      "bundles of long sticks to each of which was attached a piece of white\r\n",
      "cloth, a proceeding that excited my curiosity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Soon its object became apparent. Swiftly these men, of whom in the end\r\n",
      "there may have been thirty or forty, ran to and fro, testing the ground\r\n",
      "with spears in search for pitfalls. I think they only found a very few\r\n",
      "that had not been broken into, but in front of these and also of those\r\n",
      "that were already full of men and horses they set up the flags as a\r\n",
      "warning that they should be avoided in the advance. Also they removed a\r\n",
      "number of their wounded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We had great difficulty in restraining the White Kendah from rushing\r\n",
      "out to attack them, which of course would only have led us into a trap\r\n",
      "in our turn, since they would have fled and conducted their pursuers\r\n",
      "into the arms of the enemy. Nor would I allow my riflemen to fire, as\r\n",
      "the result must have been many misses and a great waste of ammunition\r\n",
      "which ere long would be badly wanted. I, however, did shoot two or\r\n",
      "three, then gave it up as the remainder took no notice whatever.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When they had thoroughly explored the ground they retired until, a\r\n",
      "little later, the Black Kendah army began to appear, marching in\r\n",
      "serried regiments and excellent order round the bend, till perhaps\r\n",
      "eight or ten thousand of them were visible, a very fierce and\r\n",
      "awe-inspiring _impi_. Their front ranks halted between three and four\r\n",
      "hundred yards away, which I thought farther off than it was advisable\r\n",
      "to open fire on them with Snider rifles held by unskilled troops. Then\r\n",
      "came a pause, which at length was broken by the blowing of horns and a\r\n",
      "sound of exultant shouting beyond the turn of the pass.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now from round this turn appeared the strangest sight that I think my\r\n",
      "eyes had ever seen. Yes, there came the huge elephant, Jana, at a slow,\r\n",
      "shambling trot. On his back and head were two men in whom, with my\r\n",
      "glasses, I recognized the lame priest whom I already knew too well and\r\n",
      "Simba, the king of the Black Kendah, himself, gorgeously apparelled and\r\n",
      "waving a long spear, seated in a kind of wooden chair. Round the\r\n",
      "bruteâs neck were a number of bright metal chains, twelve in all, and\r\n",
      "each of these chains was held by a spearman who ran alongside, six on\r\n",
      "one side and six on the other. Lastly, ingeniously fastened to the end\r\n",
      "of his trunk were three other chains to which were attached spiked\r\n",
      "knobs of metal.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On he came as docilely as any Indian elephant used for carrying teak\r\n",
      "logs, passing through the centre of the host up a wide lane which had\r\n",
      "been left, I suppose for his convenience, and intelligently avoiding\r\n",
      "the pitfalls filled with dead. I thought that he would stop among the\r\n",
      "first ranks. But not so. Slackening his pace to a walk he marched\r\n",
      "forwards towards our fortifications. Now, of course, I saw my chance\r\n",
      "and made sure that my double-barrelled elephant rifle was ready and\r\n",
      "that Hans held a second rifle, also double-barrelled and of similar\r\n",
      "calibre, full-cocked in such a position that I could snatch it from him\r\n",
      "in a moment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI am going to kill that elephant,â I said. âLet no one else fire.\r\n",
      "Stand still and you shall see the god Jana die.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Still the enormous beast floundered forward; up to that moment I had\r\n",
      "never realized how truly huge it was, not even when it stood over me in\r\n",
      "the moonlight about to crush me with its foot. Of this I am sure, that\r\n",
      "none to equal it ever lived in Africa, at least in any times of which I\r\n",
      "have knowledge.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âFire, Baas,â whispered Hans, âit is near enough.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But like the Frenchman and the cock pheasant, I determined to wait\r\n",
      "until it stopped, wishing to finish it with a single ball, if only for\r\n",
      "the prestige of the thing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At length it did stop and, opening its cavern of a mouth, lifted its\r\n",
      "great trunk and trumpeted, while Simba, standing up in his chair, began\r\n",
      "to shout out some command to us to surrender to the god Jana, âthe\r\n",
      "Invincible, the Invulnerable.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI will show you if you are invulnerable, my boy,â said I to myself,\r\n",
      "glancing round to make sure that Hans had the second rifle ready and\r\n",
      "catching sight of Ragnall and HarÃ»t and all the White Kendah standing\r\n",
      "up in their trenches, breathlessly awaiting the end, as were the Black\r\n",
      "Kendah a few hundred yards away. Never could there have been a fairer\r\n",
      "shot and one more certain to result in a fatal wound. The bruteâs head\r\n",
      "was up and its mouth was open. All I had to do was to send a\r\n",
      "hard-tipped bullet crashing through the palate to the brain behind. It\r\n",
      "was so easy that I would have made a bet that I could have finished him\r\n",
      "with one hand tied behind me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I lifted the heavy rifle. I got the sights dead on to a certain spot at\r\n",
      "the back of that red cave. I pressed the trigger; the charge boomedâand\r\n",
      "nothing happened! I heard no bullet strike and Jana did not even take\r\n",
      "the trouble to close his mouth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "An exclamation of âO-oh!â went up from the watchers. Before it had died\r\n",
      "away the second bullet followed the first, with the same result or\r\n",
      "rather lack of result, and another louder âO-oh!â arose. Then Jana\r\n",
      "tranquilly shut his mouth, having finished trumpeting, and as though to\r\n",
      "give me a still better target, turned broadside on and stood quite\r\n",
      "still.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With an inward curse I snatched the second rifle and aiming behind the\r\n",
      "ear at a spot which long experience told me covered the heart let drive\r\n",
      "again, first one barrel and then the other.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jana never stirred. No bullet thudded. No mark of blood appeared upon\r\n",
      "his hide. The horrible thought overcame me that I, Allan Quatermain, I\r\n",
      "the famous shot, the renowned elephant-hunter, had four times missed\r\n",
      "this haystack of a brute from a distance of forty yards. So great was\r\n",
      "my shame that I think I almost fainted. Through a kind of mist I heard\r\n",
      "various ejaculations:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âGreat Heavens!â said Ragnall.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "â_Allemagte!_â remarked Hans.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThe Child help us!â muttered HarÃ»t.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All the rest of them stared at me as though I were a freak or a\r\n",
      "lunatic. Then somebody laughed nervously, and immediately everybody\r\n",
      "began to laugh. Even the distant army of the Black Kendah became\r\n",
      "convulsed with roars of unholy merriment and I, Allan Quatermain, was\r\n",
      "the centre of all this mockery, till I felt as though I were going mad.\r\n",
      "Suddenly the laughter ceased and once more Simba the King began to roar\r\n",
      "out something about âJana the Invincible and Invulnerable,â to which\r\n",
      "the White Kendah replied with cries of âMagicâ and âBewitched!\r\n",
      "Bewitched!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYes,â yelled Simba, âno bullet can touch Jana the god, not even those\r\n",
      "of the white lord who was brought from far to kill him.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Hans leaped on to the top of the wall, where he danced up and down like\r\n",
      "an intoxicated monkey, and screamed:\r\n",

      "On they came, slowly and steadily, preceded by a cloud of skirmishersâa\r\n",
      "thousand or more of theseâwho kept as open an order as the narrow\r\n",
      "ground would allow and carried, each of them, a bundle of throwing\r\n",
      "spears arranged in loops or sockets at the back of the shield. When\r\n",
      "these men were about a hundred yards away we opened fire and killed a\r\n",
      "great number of them, also some of the marshalled troops behind. But\r\n",
      "this did not stop them in the least, for what could fifty rifles do\r\n",
      "against a horde of brave barbarians who, it seemed, had no fear of\r\n",
      "death? Presently their spears were falling among us and a few\r\n",
      "casualties began to occur, not many, because of the protecting wall,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Then, after a momentary pause another command was shouted out and the\r\n",
      "first regiment charged in three solid ranks. We fired a volley point\r\n",
      "blank into them and, as it was hopeless for fifty men to withstand such\r\n",
      "an onslaught, bolted during the temporary confusion that ensued, taking\r\n",
      "refuge, as it had been arranged that we should do, at a point of\r\n",
      "vantage farther down the line of fortifications, whence we maintained\r\n",
      "our galling fire.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now it was that the main body of the White Kendah came into action\r\n",
      "under the leadership of Ragnall and HarÃ»t. The enemy scrambled over the\r\n",
      "first wall, which we had just vacated, to find themselves in a network\r\n",
      "of other walls held by our spearmen in a narrow place where numbers\r\n",
      "gave no great advantage.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Here the fighting was terrible and the loss of the attackers great, for\r\n",
      "always as they carried one entrenchment they found another a few yards\r\n",
      "in front of them, out of which the defenders could only be driven at\r\n",
      "much cost of life.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Two hours or more the battle went on thus. In spite of the desperate\r\n",
      "resistance which we offered, the multitude of the Black Kendah, who I\r\n",
      "must say fought magnificently, stormed wall after wall, leaving\r\n",
      "hundreds of dead and wounded to mark their difficult progress.\r\n",
      "Meanwhile I and my riflemen rained bullets on them from certain\r\n",
      "positions which we had selected beforehand, until at length our\r\n",
      "ammunition began to run low.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At half-past eight in the morning we were driven back over the open\r\n",
      "ground to our last entrenchment, a very strong one just outside of the\r\n",
      "eastern gate of the temple which, it will be remembered, was set in a\r\n",
      "tunnel pierced through the natural lava rock. Thrice did the Black\r\n",
      "Kendah come on and thrice we beat them off, till the ditch in front of\r\n",
      "the wall was almost full of fallen. As fast as they climbed to the top\r\n",
      "of it the White Kendah thrust them through with their long spears, or\r\n",
      "we shot them with our rifles, the nature of the ground being such that\r\n",
      "only a direct frontal attack was possible.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the end they drew back sullenly, having, as we hoped, given up the\r\n",
      "assault. As it turned out, this was not so. They were only resting and\r\n",
      "waiting for the arrival of their reserve. It came up shouting and\r\n",
      "singing a war-song, two thousand strong or more, and presently once\r\n",
      "more they charged like a flood of water. We beat them back. They\r\n",
      "reformed and charged a second time and we beat them back.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then they took another counsel. Standing among the dead and dying at\r\n",
      "the base of the wall, which was built of loose stones and earth, where\r\n",
      "we could not easily get at them because of the showers of spears which\r\n",
      "were rained at anyone who showed himself, they began to undermine it,\r\n",
      "levering out the bottom stones with stakes and battering them with\r\n",
      "poles.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In five minutes a breach appeared, through which they poured\r\n",
      "tumultuously. It was hopeless to withstand that onslaught of so vast a\r\n",
      "number. Fighting desperately, we were driven down the tunnel and\r\n",
      "through the doors that were opened to us, into the first court of the\r\n",
      "temple. By furious efforts we managed to close these doors and block\r\n",
      "them with stones and earth. But this did not avail us long, for,\r\n",
      "bringing brushwood and dry grass, they built a fire against them that\r\n",
      "soon caught the thick cedar wood of which they were made.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While they burned we consulted together. Further retreat seemed\r\n",
      "impossible, since the second court of the temple, save for a narrow\r\n",
      "passage, was filled with corn which allowed no room for fighting, while\r\n",
      "behind it were gathered all the women and children, more than two\r\n",
      "thousand of them. Here, or nowhere, we must make our stand and conquer\r\n",
      "or die. Up to this time, compared with what which we had inflicted upon\r\n",
      "the Black Kendah, of whom a couple of thousand or more had fallen, our\r\n",
      "loss was comparatively slight, say two hundred killed and as many more\r\n",
      "wounded. Most of such of the latter as could not walk we had managed to\r\n",
      "carry into the first court of the temple, laying them close against the\r\n",
      "cloister walls, whence they watched us in a grisly ring.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This left us about sixteen hundred able-bodied men or many more than we\r\n",
      "could employ with effect in that narrow place. Therefore we determined\r\n",
      "to act upon a plan which we had already designed in case such an\r\n",
      "emergency as ours should arise. About three hundred and fifty of the\r\n",
      "best men were to remain to defend the temple till all were slain. The\r\n",
      "rest, to the number of over a thousand, were to withdraw through the\r\n",
      "second court and the gates beyond to the camp of the women and\r\n",
      "children. These they were to conduct by secret paths that were known to\r\n",
      "them to where the camels were kraaled, and mounting as many as possible\r\n",
      "of them on the camels to fly whither they could. Our hope was that the\r\n",
      "victorious Black Kendah would be too exhausted to follow them across\r\n",
      "the plain to the distant mountains. It was a dreadful determination,\r\n",
      "but we had no choice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhat of my wife?â Ragnall asked hoarsely.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhile the temple stands she must remain in the temple,â replied HarÃ»t.\r\n",
      "âBut when all is lost, if I have fallen, do you, White Lord, go to the\r\n",
      "sanctuary with those who remain and take her and the Ivory Child and\r\n",
      "flee after the others. Only I lay this charge on you under pain of the\r\n",
      "curse of Heaven, that you do not suffer the Ivory Child to fall into\r\n",
      "the hands of the Black Kendah. First must you burn it with fire or\r\n",
      "grind it to dust with stones. Moreover, I give this command to all in\r\n",
      "case the priests in charge of it should fail me, that they set flame to\r\n",
      "the brushwood that is built up with the stacks of corn, so that, after\r\n",
      "all, those of our enemies who escape may die of famine.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Instantly and without murmuring, for never did I see more perfect\r\n",
      "discipline than that which prevailed among these poor people, the\r\n",
      "orders given by HarÃ»t, who in addition to his office as head priest was\r\n",
      "a kind of president of what was in fact a republic, were put in the way\r\n",
      "of execution. Company by company the men appointed to escort the women\r\n",
      "and children departed through the gateway of the second court, each\r\n",
      "company turning in the gateway to salute us who remained, by raising\r\n",
      "their spears, till all were gone. Then we, the three hundred and fifty\r\n",
      "who were left, marshalled ourselves as the Greeks may have done in the\r\n",
      "Pass of ThermopylÃ¦.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "First stood I and my riflemen, to whom all the remaining ammunition was\r\n",
      "served out; it amounted to eight rounds per man. Then, ranged across\r\n",
      "the court in four lines, came the spearmen armed with lances and swords\r\n",
      "under the immediate command of HarÃ»t. Behind these, near the gate of\r\n",
      "the second court so that at the last they might attempt the rescue of\r\n",
      "the priestess, were fifty picked men, captained by Ragnall, who, I\r\n",
      "forgot to say, was wounded in two places, though not badly, having\r\n",
      "received a spear thrust in the left shoulder and a sword cut to the\r\n",
      "left thigh during his desperate defence of the entrenchment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By the time that all was ready and every man had been given to drink\r\n",
      "from the great jars of water which stood along the walls, the massive\r\n",
      "wooden doors began to burn through, though this did not happen for\r\n",
      "quite half an hour after the enemy had begun to attempt to fire them.\r\n",
      "They fell at length beneath the battering of poles, leaving only the\r\n",
      "mound of earth and stones which we had piled up in the gateway after\r\n",
      "the closing of the doors. This the Black Kendah, who had raked out the\r\n",
      "burning embers, set themselves to dig away with hands and sticks and\r\n",
      "spears, a task that was made very difficult to them by about a score of\r\n",
      "our people who stabbed at them with their long lances or dashed them\r\n",
      "down with stones, killing and disabling many. But always the dead and\r\n",
      "wounded were dragged off while others took their places, so that at\r\n",
      "last the gateway was practically cleared. Then I called back the\r\n",
      "spearmen who passed into the ranks behind us, and made ready to play my\r\n",
      "part.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I had not long to wait. With a rush and a roar a great company of the\r\n",
      "Black Kendah charged the gateway. Just as they began to emerge into the\r\n",
      "court I gave the word to fire, sending fifty Snider bullets tearing\r\n",
      "into them from a distance of a few yards. They fell in a heap; they\r\n",
      "fell like corn before the scythe, not a man won through. Quickly we\r\n",
      "reloaded and waited for the next rush. In due course it came and the\r\n",
      "dreadful scene repeated itself. Now the gateway and the tunnel beyond\r\n",
      "were so choked with fallen men that the enemy must drag these out\r\n",
      "before they could charge any more. It was done under the fire of\r\n",
      "myself, Hans and a few picked shotsâsomehow it was done.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Once more they charged, and once more were mown down. So it went on\r\n",
      "till our last cartridge was spent, for never did I see more magnificent\r\n",
      "courage than was shown by those Black Kendah in the face of terrific\r\n",
      "loss. Then my people threw aside their useless rifles and arming\r\n",
      "themselves with spears and swords fell back to rest, leaving HarÃ»t and\r\n",
      "his company to take their place. For half an hour or more raged that\r\n",
      "awful struggle, since the spot being so narrow, charge as they would,\r\n",
      "the Black Kendah could not win through the spears of despairing\r\n",
      "warriors defending their lives and the sanctuary of their god. Nor, the\r\n",
      "encircling cliffs being so sheer, could they get round any other way.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At length the enemy drew back as though defeated, giving us time to\r\n",
      "drag aside our dead and wounded and drink more water, for the heat in\r\n",
      "the place was now overwhelming. We hoped against hope that they had\r\n",
      "given up the attack. But this was far from the case; they were but\r\n",
      "making a new plan.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Suddenly in the gateway there appeared the huge bulk of the elephant\r\n",
      "Jana, rushing forward at speed and being urged on by men who pricked it\r\n",
      "with spears behind. It swept through the defenders as though they were\r\n",
      "but dry grass, battering those in front of it with its great trunk from\r\n",
      "which swung the iron balls that crushed all on whom they fell, and\r\n",
      "paying no more heed to the lance thrusts than it might have done to the\r\n",
      "bites of gnats. On it came, trumpeting and trampling, and after it in a\r\n",
      "flood flowed the Black Kendah, upon whom our spearmen flung themselves\r\n",
      "from either side.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At the time I, followed by Hans, was just returning from speaking with\r\n",
      "Ragnall at the gate of the second court. A little before I had retired\r\n",
      "exhausted from the fierce and fearful fighting, whereon he took my\r\n",
      "place and repelled several of the Black Kendah charges, including the\r\n",
      "last. In this fray he received a further injury, a knock on the head\r\n",
      "from a stick or stone which stunned him for a few minutes, whereon some\r\n",
      "of our people had carried him off and set him on the ground with his\r\n",
      "back against one of the pillars of the second gate. Being told that he\r\n",
      "was hurt I ran to see what was the matter. Finding to my joy that it\r\n",
      "was nothing very serious, I was hurrying to the front again when I\r\n",
      "looked up and saw that devil Jana charging straight towards me, the\r\n",
      "throng of armed men parting on each side of him, as rough water does\r\n",
      "before the leaping prow of a storm-driven ship.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To tell the truth, although I was never fond of unnecessary risks, I\r\n",
      "rejoiced at the sight. Not even all the excitement of that hideous and\r\n",
      "prolonged battle had obliterated from my mind the burning sense of\r\n",
      "shame at the exhibition which I had made of myself by missing this\r\n",
      "beast with four barrels at forty yards.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, thought I to myself with a kind of exultant thrill, now, Jana, I\r\n",
      "will wipe out both my disgrace and you. This time there shall be no\r\n",
      "mistake, or if there is, let it be my last.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On thundered Jana, whirling the iron balls among the soldiers, who fled\r\n",
      "to right and left leaving a clear path between me and him. To make\r\n",
      "quite sure of things, for I was trembling a little with fatigue and\r\n",
      "somewhat sick from the continuous sight of bloodshed, I knelt down upon\r\n",
      "my right knee, using the other as a prop for my left elbow, and since I\r\n",
      "could not make certain of a head shot because of the continual whirling\r\n",
      "of the huge trunk, got the sight of my big-game rifle dead on to the\r\n",
      "beast where the throat joins the chest. I hoped that the heavy conical\r\n",
      "bullet would either pierce through to the spine or cut one of the large\r\n",
      "arteries in the neck, or at least that the tremendous shock of its\r\n",
      "impact would bring him down.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At about twenty paces I fired and hitânot Jana but the lame priest who\r\n",
      "was fulfilling the office of mahout, perched upon his shoulders many\r\n",
      "feet above the point at which I had aimed. Yes! I hit him in the head,\r\n",
      "which was shattered like an eggshell, so that he fell lifeless to the\r\n",
      "ground.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In perfect desperation again I aimed, and fired when Jana was not more\r\n",
      "than thirty feet away. This time the bullet must have gone wide to the\r\n",
      "left, for I saw a chip fly from the end of the animalâs broken and\r\n",
      "deformed tusk, which stuck out in that direction several feet clear of\r\n",
      "its side.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then I gave up all hope. There was no time to gain my feet and escape;\r\n",
      "indeed I did not wish to do so, who felt that there are some failures\r\n",
      "which can only be absolved by death. I just knelt there, waiting for\r\n",
      "the end.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In an instant the giant creature was almost over me. I remember looking\r\n",
      "up at it and thinking in a queer sort of a wayâperhaps it was some\r\n",
      "ancestral memoryâthat I was a little ape-like child about to be slain\r\n",
      "by a primordial elephant, thrice as big as any that now inhabit the\r\n",
      "earth. Then something appeared to happen which I only repeat to show\r\n",
      "how at such moments absurd and impossible things seem real to us.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The reader may remember the strange dream which Hans had related to me\r\n",
      "that morning.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One incident of this phantasy was that he had met the spirit of the\r\n",
      "Zulu lady Mameena, whom I knew in bygone years, and that she bade him\r\n",
      "tell me she would be with me in the battle and that I was to look for\r\n",
      "her when death drew near to me and âJana thundered on,â for then\r\n",
      "perchance I should see her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Well, no doubt in some lightning flash of thought the memory of these\r\n",
      "words occurred to me at this juncture, with the ridiculous result that\r\n",
      "my subjective intelligence, if that is the right term, actually created\r\n",
      "the scene which they described. As clearly, or perhaps more clearly\r\n",
      "than ever I saw anything else in my life, I appeared to behold the\r\n",
      "beautiful Mameena in her fur cloak and her blue beads, standing between\r\n",
      "Jana and myself with her arms folded upon her breast and looking\r\n",
      "exactly as she did in the tremendous moment of her death before King\r\n",
      "Panda. I even noted how the faint breeze stirred a loose end of her\r\n",
      "outspread hair and how the sunlight caught a particular point of a\r\n",
      "copper bangle on her upper arm.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So she stood, or rather seemed to stand, quite still; and as it\r\n",
      "happened, at that moment the giant Jana, either because something had\r\n",
      "frightened him, or perhaps owing to the shock of my bullet striking on\r\n",
      "his tusk having jarred the brain, suddenly pulled up, sliding along a\r\n",
      "little with all his four feet together, till I thought he was going to\r\n",
      "sit down like a performing elephant. Then it appeared to me as though\r\n",
      "Mameena turned round very slowly, bent towards me, whispering something\r\n",
      "which I could not hear although her lips moved, looked at me sweetly\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "A fraction of a second later all this vision had gone and something\r\n",
      "that was no vision took its place. Jana had recovered himself and was\r\n",
      "at me again with open mouth and lifted trunk. I heard a Dutch curse and\r\n",
      "saw a little yellow form; saw Hans, for it was he, thrust the barrels\r\n",
      "of my second elephant rifle almost into that red cave of a mouth, which\r\n",
      "however they could not reach, and fire, first one barrel, then the\r\n",
      "other.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Another moment, and the mighty trunk had wrapped itself about Hans and\r\n",
      "hurled him through the air to fall on to his head and arms thirty or\r\n",
      "forty feet away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jana staggered as though he too were about to fall; recovered himself,\r\n",
      "swerved to the right, perhaps to follow Hans, stumbled on a few paces,\r\n",
      "missing me altogether, then again came to a standstill. I wriggled\r\n",
      "myself round and, seated on the pavement of the court, watched what\r\n",
      "followed, and glad am I that I was able to do so, for never shall I\r\n",
      "behold such another scene.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "First I saw Ragnall run up with a rifle and fire two barrels at the\r\n",
      "bruteâs head, of which he took no notice whatsoever. Then I saw his\r\n",
      "wife, who in this land was known as the Guardian of the Child, issuing\r\n",
      "from the portals of the second court, dressed in her goddess robes,\r\n",
      "wearing the cap of birdâs feathers, attended by the two priestesses\r\n",
      "also dressed as goddesses, as we had seen her on the morning of\r\n",
      "sacrifice, and holding in front of her the statue of the Ivory Child.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On she came quite quietly, her wide, empty eyes fixed upon Jana. As she\r\n",
      "advanced the monster seemed to grow uneasy. Turning his head, he lifted\r\n",
      "his trunk and thrust it along his back until it gripped the ankle of\r\n",
      "the King Simba, who all this while was seated there in his chair making\r\n",
      "no movement.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With a slow, steady pull he dragged Simba from the chair so that he\r\n",
      "fell upon the ground near his left foreleg. Next very composedly he\r\n",
      "wound his trunk about the body of the helpless man, whose horrified\r\n",
      "eyes I can see to this day, and began to whirl him round and round in\r\n",
      "the air, gently at first but with a motion that grew ever more rapid,\r\n",
      "until the bright chains on the victimâs breast flashed in the sunlight\r\n",
      "like a silver wheel. Then he hurled him to the ground, where the poor\r\n",
      "king lay a mere shattered pulp that had been human.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now the priestess was standing in front of the beast-god, apparently\r\n",
      "quite without fear, though her two attendants had fallen back. Ragnall\r\n",
      "sprang forward as though to drag her away, but a dozen men leapt on to\r\n",
      "him and held him fast, either to save his life or for some secret\r\n",
      "reason of their own which I never learned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jana looked down at her and she looked up at Jana. Then he screamed\r\n",
      "furiously and, shooting out his trunk, snatched the Ivory Child from\r\n",
      "her hands, whirled it round as he had whirled Simba, and at last dashed\r\n",
      "it to the stone pavement as he had dashed Simba, so that its substance,\r\n",
      "grown brittle in the passage of the ages, shattered into ten thousand\r\n",
      "fragments.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this sight a great groan went up from the men of the White Kendah,\r\n",
      "the women dressed as goddesses shrieked and tore their robes, and\r\n",
      "HarÃ»t, who stood near, fell down in a fit or faint.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Once more Jana screamed. Then slowly he knelt down, beat his trunk and\r\n",
      "the clattering metal balls upon the ground thrice, as though he were\r\n",
      "making obeisance to the beautiful priestess who stood before him,\r\n",
      "shivered throughout his mighty bulk, and rolled overâdead!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The fighting ceased. The Black Kendah, who all this while had been\r\n",
      "pressing into the court of the temple, saw and stood stupefied. It was\r\n",
      "as though in the presence of events to them so pregnant and terrible\r\n",
      "men could no longer lift their swords in war.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "them, nor did any attempt to stay them. Thirty minutes later, save for\r\n",
      "some desperately hurt or dying men, not one of them was left in the\r\n",
      "temple or the pass beyond. They had all gone, leaving none but the dead\r\n",
      "behind them.\r\n",

      "now that all was over I felt as if I were made of running water, I saw\r\n",

      "his wife was and stood before her as though confused, much as Jana had\r\n",
      "stood, Jana against whose head he rested, his left hand holding to the\r\n",
      "bruteâs gigantic tusk, for I think that he also was weak with toil,\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "passed between them, for my curiosity overcame my faintness. For quite\r\n",
      "a long while she stared at him, till suddenly her eyes began to change.\r\n",
      "It was as though a soul were arising in their emptiness as the moon\r\n",
      "arises in the quiet evening sky, giving them light and life. At length\r\n",
      "she spoke in a slow, hesitating voice, the tones of which I remembered\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Here I may state two things: first, that Lady Ragnall, whose bodily\r\n",
      "health had remained perfect throughout, entirely recovered her reason\r\n",
      "from that moment. It was as though on the shattering of the Ivory Child\r\n",
      "some spell had been lifted off her. What this spell may have been I am\r\n",
      "quite unable to explain, but I presume that in a dim and unknown way\r\n",
      "she connected this effigy with her own lost infant and that while she\r\n",
      "held and tended it her intellect remained in abeyance. If so, she must\r\n",
      "also have connected its destruction with the death of her own child\r\n",
      "which, strangely enough, it will be remembered, was likewise killed by\r\n",
      "an elephant. The first death that occurred in her presence took away\r\n",
      "her reason, the second seeming death, which also occurred in her\r\n",
      "presence, brought it back again!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Secondly, from the moment of the destruction of her boy in the streets\r\n",
      "of the English country town to that of the shattering of the Ivory\r\n",
      "Child in Central Africa her memory was an utter blank, with one\r\n",
      "exception. This exception was a dream which a few days later she\r\n",
      "narrated to Ragnall in my presence. That dream was that she had seen\r\n",
      "him and Savage sleeping together in a native house one night. In view\r\n",
      "of a certain incident recorded in this history I leave the reader to\r\n",

      "found him lying senseless near the north wall of the temple. Evidently\r\n",
      "he was beyond human help, for Jana seemed to have crushed most of his\r\n",
      "ribs in his iron trunk. We carried him to one of the priestâs cells and\r\n",
      "there I watched him till the end, which came at sundown.\r\n",

      "The truth is that after the death of Hans, like to Queen Sheba when she\r\n",
      "had surveyed the wonders of Solomonâs court, there was no more spirit\r\n",
      "in me. For quite a long while I did not seem to care at all what\r\n",
      "happened to me or to anybody else. We buried him in a place of honour,\r\n",
      "exactly where he shot Jana before the gateway of the second court, and\r\n",
      "when the earth was thrown over his little yellow face I felt as though\r\n",

      "something that cares for him _alone_, which is just why we are so fond\r\n",
      "of dogs. Now Hans was a dog with a human brain and he cared for me\r\n",
      "alone. Often our vanity makes us think that this has happened to some\r\n",
      "of us in the instance of one or more women. But honest and quiet\r\n",
      "reflection may well cause us to doubt the truth of such supposings. The\r\n",
      "woman who as we believed adored us solely has probably in the course of\r\n",

      "To take but one instance, that of Mameena, the Zulu lady whom Hans\r\n",

      "very fond of me, but I am convinced that she was fonder still of her\r\n",
      "ambition. Now Hans never cared for any living creature, or for any\r\n",
      "human hope or object, as he cared for me. There was no man or woman\r\n",
      "whom he would not have cheated, or even murdered for my sake. There was\r\n",
      "no earthly advantage, down to that of life itself, that he would not,\r\n",
      "and in the end did not forgo for my sake; witness the case of his\r\n",
      "little fortune which he invested in my rotten gold mine and thought\r\n",
      "nothing of losingâfor my sake.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That is love _in excelsis_, and the man who has succeeded in inspiring\r\n",
      "it in any creature, even in a low, bibulous, old Hottentot, may feel\r\n",
      "proud indeed. At least I am proud and as the years go by the pride\r\n",
      "increases, as the hope grows that somewhere in the quiet of that great\r\n",
      "plain which he saw in his dream, I may find the light of Hansâs love\r\n",
      "burning like a beacon in the darkness, as he promised I should do, and\r\n",

      "record elephant of the world, but I had no time to do so and no rule or\r\n",

      "just as he was being tumbled into a huge hole, together with the\r\n",
      "remains of his master, Simba the King. I found, however, that the sole\r\n",
      "wounds upon him, save some cuts and scratches from spears, were those\r\n",

      "their victory over the god of their foes. At any rate they hewed the\r\n",

      "recall him curiously dressed with feathers and holding an ivory rod,\r\n",
      "seated upon a stool at the feet of a great personageâa king, I think.\r\n",
      "The king asked him questions, and everyone listened to his answers.\r\n",

      "sunlight.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "I said this because I did not wish to pursue the conversation. I\r\n",

      "eyes, which I remembered noting before she was married.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "me. For the rest you need not be afraid, Mr. Quatermain. I did not lose\r\n",

      "a thing?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "â_You_ did,â she answered, looking me in the eyes. âNow before we go I\r\n",
      "want to say one more thing. HarÃ»t and the head priestess have made me a\r\n",
      "present. They have given me a box full of that herb they called\r\n",
      "tobacco, but of which I have discovered the real name is Taduki. It is\r\n",
      "the same that they burned in the bowl when you and I saw visions at\r\n",

      "coincidences, have since been translated into facts.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI know. We saw you breathe that smoke again as priestess when you\r\n",

      "First-fruits. But what are you going to do with this stuff, Lady\r\n",
      "Ragnall? I think you have had enough of visions just at present.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âSo do I, though to tell you the truth I like them. I am going to keep\r\n",
      "it and do nothingâas yet. Still, I want you always to remember one\r\n",
      "thingâdonât laugh at meââhere again she looked me in the eyesââthat\r\n",
      "there is a time coming, some way off I think, when I and youâno one\r\n",
      "else, Mr. Quatermainâwill breathe that smoke again together and see\r\n",
      "strange things.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNo, no!â I replied, âI have given up tobacco of the Kendah variety; it\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âYes, yes!â she said, âfor something that is stronger than the Kendah\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âDid HarÃ»t tell you that, Lady Ragnall?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI donât know,â she answered confusedly. âI think the Ivory Child told\r\n",
      "me; it used to talk to me often. You know that Child isnât really\r\n",
      "destroyed. Like my reason that seemed to be lost, it has only gone\r\n",
      "backwards or forwards where you and I shall see it again. You and I and\r\n",
      "no othersâunless it be the little yellow man. I repeat that I do not\r\n",
      "know when that will be. Perhaps it is written in those rolls of\r\n",
      "papyrus, which they have given me also, because they said they belonged\r\n",
      "to me who am âthe first priestess and the last.â They told me, however,\r\n",
      "or perhaps,â she added, passing her hand across her forehead, âit was\r\n",
      "the Child who told me, that I was not to attempt to read them or have\r\n",
      "them read, until after a great change in my life. What the change will\r\n",
      "be I do not know.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAnd had better not inquire, Lady Ragnall, since in this world most\r\n",
      "changes are for the worse.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI agree, and shall not inquire. Now I have spoken to you like this\r\n",
      "because I felt that I must do so. Also I want to thank you for all you\r\n",
      "have done for me and George. Probably we shall not talk in such a way\r\n",
      "again; as I am situated the opportunity will be lacking, even if the\r\n",
      "wish is present. So once more I thank you from my heart. Until we meet\r\n",
      "againâI mean really meetâgood-bye,â and she held her right hand to me\r\n",
      "in such a fashion that I knew she meant me to kiss it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This I did very reverently and we walked back to the temple almost in\r\n",
      "silence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That month of rest, or rather the last three weeks of it, since for the\r\n",
      "first few days after the battle I was quite prostrate, I occupied in\r\n",
      "various ways, amongst others in a journey with HarÃ»t to Simba Town.\r\n",
      "This we made after our spies had assured us that the Black Kendah were\r\n",
      "really gone somewhere to the south-west, in which direction fertile and\r\n",
      "unoccupied lands were said to exist about three hundred miles away. It\r\n",
      "was with very strange feelings that I retraced our road and looked once\r\n",
      "more upon that wind-bent tree still scored with the marks of Janaâs\r\n",
      "huge tusk, in the boughs of which Hans and I had taken refuge from the\r\n",
      "monsterâs fury. Crossing the river, quite low now, I travelled up the\r\n",
      "slope down which we raced for our lives and came to the melancholy lake\r\n",
      "and the cemetery of dead elephants.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Here all was unchanged. There was the little mount worn by his feet, on\r\n",
      "which Jana was wont to stand. There were the rocks behind which I had\r\n",
      "tried to hide, and near to them some crushed human bones which I knew\r\n",
      "to be those of the unfortunate MarÃ»t. These we buried with due\r\n",
      "reverence on the spot where he had fallen, I meanwhile thanking God\r\n",
      "that my own bones were not being interred at their side, as but for\r\n",
      "Hans would have been the caseâif they were ever interred at all. All\r\n",
      "about lay the skeletons of dead elephants, and from among these we\r\n",
      "collected as much of the best ivory as we could carry, namely about\r\n",
      "fifty camel loads. Of course there was much more, but a great deal of\r\n",
      "the stuff had been exposed for so long to sun and weather that it was\r\n",
      "almost worthless.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Having sent this ivory back to the Town of the Child, which was being\r\n",
      "rebuilt after a fashion, we went on to Simba Town through the forest,\r\n",
      "dispatching pickets ahead of us to search and make sure that it was\r\n",
      "empty. Empty it was indeed; never did I see such a place of desolation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Black Kendah had left it just as it stood, except for a pile of\r\n",
      "corpses which lay around and over the altar in the market-place, where\r\n",
      "the three poor camelmen were sacrificed to Jana, doubtless those of\r\n",
      "wounded men who had died during or after the retreat. The doors of the\r\n",
      "houses stood open, many domestic articles, such as great jars\r\n",
      "resembling that which had been set over the head of the dead man whom\r\n",
      "we were commanded to restore life, and other furniture lay about\r\n",
      "because they could not be carried away. So did a great quantity of\r\n",
      "spears and various weapons of war, whose owners being killed would\r\n",
      "never want them again. Except a few starved dogs and jackals no living\r\n",
      "creature remained in the town. It was in its own way as waste and even\r\n",
      "more impressive than the graveyard of elephants by the lonely lake.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThe curse of the Child worked well,â said HarÃ»t to me grimly. âFirst,\r\n",
      "the storm; the hunger; then the battle; and now the misery of flight\r\n",
      "and ruin.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIt seems so,â I answered. âYet that curse, like others, came back to\r\n",

      "which MarÃ»t and I had been imprisoned during our dreadful days of fear,\r\n",
      "reconstructing in my mind every event connected with them. Once more I\r\n",
      "saw the fires of sacrifice flaring upon the altar and heard the roar of\r\n",
      "the dancing hail that proclaimed the ruin of the Black Kendah as loudly\r\n",
      "as the trumpet of a destroying angel. Very glad was I when the morning\r\n",
      "came at length and, having looked my last upon Simba Town, I crossed\r\n",
      "the moats and set out homewards through the forest whereof the stripped\r\n",

      "Ten days later we started from the Holy Mount, a caravan of about a\r\n",
      "hundred camels, of which fifty were laden with the ivory and the rest\r\n",
      "ridden by our escort under the command of HarÃ»t and our three selves.\r\n",
      "But there was an evil fate upon this ivory, as on everything else that\r\n",
      "had to do with Jana. Some weeks later in the desert a great sandstorm\r\n",
      "overtook us in which we barely escaped with our lives. At the height of\r\n",
      "the storm the ivory-laden camels broke loose, flying before it.\r\n",

      "into thousands of pounds, but I would not take the money, saying it was\r\n",
      "outside our bargain. Sometimes since then I have thought that I was\r\n",
      "foolish, especially when on glancing at that codicil to his will in\r\n",
      "after days, the same which he had given me before the battle, I found\r\n",
      "that he had set me down for a legacy of Â£10,000. But in such matters\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The White Kendah, an unemotional people especially now when they were\r\n",
      "mourning for their lost god and their dead, watched us go without any\r\n",
      "demonstration of affection, or even of farewell. Only those priestesses\r\n",
      "who had attended upon the person of Lady Ragnall while she played a\r\n",
      "divine part among them wept when they parted from her, and uttered\r\n",
      "prayers that they might meet her again âin the presence of the Child.â\r\n",

      "ever at the land which we had left, where the Mount of the Child was\r\n",
